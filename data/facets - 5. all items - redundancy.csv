"FACETS-60","Academic Skills and School Functioning","Academic Motivation","applying skills and abilities to achieve academic goals","Academic motivation is an individual’s general commitment to scholarly/learning activities. It includes not only the determination to acquire knowledge and skills in school, but also the development of the tools necessary to successfully perform in the academic context. While often reduced to “grades,” this method fails to capture the commitment necessary to establish and maintain appropriate subject level knowledge and skills (e.g., mathematics, science, language, history, etc.), as well as the willingness to flexibly and adaptively use general and specific resources (e.g., mentors, libraries, collaboration, etc.) needed to succeed.","0.32","Attention/Concentration","0.957","Academic Motivation","No","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Academic Skills and School Functioning","Mathematics","cognitively and mechanically performing arithmetic operations","Math, or arithmetic, is the ability to manage numerical and/or quantitative ideas, both conceptually and in graphical representations. Mathematical skills evolve over time, beginning using numbers for the concrete counting of objects, evolving into the appreciation that numbers can representing various constructs such as quantity, time, space, etc. Success with math can be confounded by writing difficulty as “imprecise” presentation of numbers leads to errors.","0.353","Reading","0.799","mathematics","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Academic Skills and School Functioning","Reading","cognitive and mechanical elements of reading comprehension","Reading is the ability to decode written symbols for purposes of communication and learning. While reading most commonly focuses on symbols referred to as “letters” or “characters” from alphabets, in fact, decoding any symbols is a form of reading, including symbols such as logos, flags, and other devices.

"FACETS-60","Academic Skills and School Functioning","Writing","cognitive and mechanical elements of written expression","Writing is the graphical representation of ideas that consists of two separate and distinct actions. The first is the cognitive process of changing an idea into the symbols (letters, characters, or other) in preparation for writing. The second is the motor process of producing the “written” symbols that present an idea in whatever medium is chosen (paper, computer screen, etc.), in a fashion that is potentially comprehensible by others. While letters and complex symbols form the basis of developmentally sophisticated writing, the simple graphic productions (e.g., scribbles) of young children and others with limited skills, can be very effective communication tools.","0.622","Reading","0.639","conveys information in writing","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Activity Level","maintaining physical and cognitive activity","For successful adaptation, it is critical that individuals apply activity levels consistent with the tasks and the environment.

"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Morning Routine","being ready when arriving at school","Most people have a set of behaviors or actions for the beginning of each day that generally follow in a usual order and are designed to complete necessary tasks in preparation for the day’s activities. They begin with arising with sufficient time to avoid being late for the start of school, work or other daytime obligations; routines may include activities such as toileting, hygiene, dressing appropriately, eating, gathering one’s necessary belongings, and departing in a timely fashion so as to arrive at the first appointment of the day. Typically these routines are well-established so that they occur relatively automatically, obviating the need for detailed thinking about each task. In some cases, the individual does some preparation the evening before, in order to assure prompt completion of morning routines.","0.512","Habits/Routines","0.605","Daily Self-Care Routines","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Physically Harms Self","causing injury to self","Persistent thoughts of self-harm, especially thoughts that lead to actions causing harm, are always problematic, and usually require urgent attention. Self-harm may or may not have suicidal intent, although the risk for suicidal behavior is increased in the presence of self-harm. In moments of despair or incredible anger, typical individuals may rarely have thoughts of self-harm. However, these thoughts are readily recognized as inappropriate and quickly managed without any action directed toward self-harm.","0.676","Physically or Emotionally Harms Others","0.414","self-control","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Physically or Emotionally Harms Others","causing physical or emotional harm to other persons","Persistent thoughts of harm to others, especially those that lead to actions that cause harm are always problematic, and usually require urgent attention. Harm to others may also include emotional harm. Ideas about harming others usually has no homicidal intent, however, these wishes to cause physical or emotional harm to others may lead to serious consequences. As a result, in the presence of these thoughts, careful evaluations are necessary, and targets of the harmful thoughts (e.g., animals, children, other adults) should be protected until the potential threat has passed.","0.676","Physically Harms Self","0.433","self-control","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Risk Taking","taking chances to achieve goals when faced with possible failure embarrassment or harm","Risk taking is the ability to overcome the possibility of failure, embarrassment, or harm in order to achieve a specific goal or to acquire a particular want or need.

"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Self-Control","managing impulses and self-regulating behavior","Effective social adaptations and goal seeking requires the ability to resist non-productive impulses and distractions that may interfere with achieving a goal. Self-control is the ability to manage the full spectrum of one’s behaviors in order to quickly, flexibly, and effectively adapt as one attempts to meet one’s personal and social needs. This means maintaining control over language, social, and motor behavior, while being sensitive and responsive to other environmental factors such as the behaviors of others who are sharing time and space. Self-control includes the ability to both behave proactively and reactively, as well as to inhibit unnecessary or inappropriate behavior.","0.561","Responsibility for Self & Others","0.868","self-control","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Sensory Reactivity","responding to sensory input including touch taste smell sight hearing and somatic","There is enormous individual variability in the perception and ability to interpret and respond to sensory input. Sensations typically includes the five senses (e.g., touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing), however, somatic perceptions (e.g., pain, heart rate, respiratory rate, kinesthetics, etc.) are often sensed quite acutely, and can modulate emotions, cognitions, and behavior. Precision in the identification of sensory inputs and the reaction to them is essential for safe interactions with the environment as well as appropriate social function.","0.442","Emotion Regulation/Reactivity","0.569","gathering data through all senses","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Behavior Control and Regulation","Transitions","transitioning between activities or places","Leaving home or other sites (e.g., school) requires preparation that is often captured in routines so that all the elements of the departure are well-coordinated, with little emotional or behavioral disruption, and no necessary items are left behind. It is important to anticipate pending transitions and plan for what comes next. The departure requires the timely gathering of objects necessary for the transition, so that the departure can take place in an orderly and timely fashion. Transitions routines often use appropriate social elements (e.g., “Good-bye,” “See you tomorrow,” “Thank you,” waving or hugs, etc.), as well as addressing of safety concerns (e.g., “hold my hand”, “put on your seat belt”, etc.)","0.436","Morning Routine","0.748","Transitions","Yes","Yes"

"FACETS-60","Emotional Expression","Emotion Regulation/Reactivity","managing threshold and intensity of emotional responses","Emotions are strong feelings derived from internal and external stimuli that are reflected in mood and responsive to environmental factors and relationships with others. These feelings may range broadly and include joy, happiness, love, euphoria, anxiety, sadness, fear, loss, and many more. These emotions play a critical role in social communication, motivation, and protection. However, in order to maintain adaptive functioning, emotions require careful regulation in terms of type, intensity, and duration of emotional expression, each of which must be sensitive to environmental, social, and cultural factors.","0.523","Anger Management","0.832","emotion regulation","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Emotional Expression","Irritability","reacting to frustration or annoyance","Irritability is a feeling of agitation and annoyance in response to a stimulus or stress. Irritability can be an appropriate response to a offensive social or physical stimulus that becomes problematic, however, the appropriate intensity of such a response varies based on the intensity and persistence of the stimulus, as well as the social context. Irritability can range from a mild facial expression or gesture to a massive outpouring of emotions.","0.522","Anger Management","0.853","Irritability","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Emotional Expression","Obsessive Thoughts","managing recurring thoughts or ideas","Sustained, recurring, goal-directed thoughts or ideas assist in focussing attention and activity in support of completing a task. In addition to helping sustain attention or focus, revisiting the thought or idea supports problem-solving or re-working options necessary to achieve a goal. When these thoughts are persistent and intrusive, they interfere with social, behavioral, and/or cognitive function. Persistent thoughts may include perseveration on specific or irrelevant topics, numbers, words, sounds, or tasks.","0.414","Worries/Anxiety/Fears","0.551","Excessive Worry","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Emotional Expression","Stress Management","managing tension resulting from challenges or demands","Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension that is the body’s reaction to an internal or external challenge or demand. The internal factors can be thoughts, ideas, emotions, or even cognitive and emotional challenges. External factors may include leisure, work, or social demands.

"FACETS-60","Emotional Expression","Worries/Anxiety/Fears","managing worries and anxiety","Worries are the result of fears or anxiety. The stimulus for worries can be internal or external. External worries often come from frightening or forbidden objects or events. Internal worries are often associated with self-doubt or lack of confidence, as well as legitimate concerns about objects or events from the past or anticipated in the future. Worries come in many forms, and while they generally reflect internal feeling states, they are commonly expressed as behaviors including the appearance of being anxious, excess vocalization of the worry, or avoidance.","0.414","Obsessive Thoughts","0.667","General Worry","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Expressive Communication","Expressive Language","communicating with speech and gestures","Expressive Language includes words and sounds, powerfully augmented by non-verbal communication, including gestures, body posture, facial expression etc. There are many subtle elements that enhance the breadth, depth and nuance of expressive language. These include rate, rhythm, volume, prosody, and tone of speech, as well as vocabulary and word choice. Effective expressive communication requires the flexible, skillful combination of gestures and spoken words. It takes considerable effort to communicate functionally, yet remarkably, even from early life, typically developing individuals are able to express to others their ideas, feelings, wants, and needs. These skills grow in complexity over the course of the lifespan, however, there is considerable variability amongst individuals that depends on biological make-up, cognitive ability, environmental factors, and cultural/social experiences.","0.645","Receptive Language","0.738","Expressive Communication","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Expressive Communication","Speech Quality","speaking understandably","Speech is the production of sounds that are most often formed into words which can be linked to form sentences, paragraphs, descriptions, requests, stories, and much more. Using variations in rate, tone, rhythm, volume, clarity, word/sound selection, coordination with non-verbal communication, and other elements of sound production enhance the understandability of the intended communication. Flexible and adaptable speech offers greater possibility that the intended message will be received and properly interpreted by the listener.","0.652","Speech Quantity","0.468","Verbal Expression","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Expressive Communication","Speech Quantity","speaking with an appropriate number of words for communication","Language is the full spectrum of communicative behaviors. It includes words, gestures, body posture, facial expression, and a myriad of other behaviors that have communicative intent. This item refers ONLY to spoken language - speech. There is enormous variation in speech quantity that is partly dependent on context (“Is this a time to be quiet or a time to offer to speak up?”) and also depends on the capability of the individual to speak about specific content (“Does the individual know anything about the present topic?” “Are they lacking confidence with respect to that content?”) Or, does the individual have the physical ability to produce speech at all. Thus, the quantity of speech may typically vary depending on context and content, however, individuals with problems related to speech quantity have difficulty regulating the amount of speaking in appropriate response to the context or content.","0.652","Speech Quality","0.525","Verbal Expression","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Eating","maintaining dietary intake and nutrition","Eating is a complex behavior that has both nutritional and social components. The nutritional component is the appropriate consumption of both calories (for energy) and the elements of the diet (protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, etc.) necessary for maintaining healthy function. There are two main social components of eating: the social interactions associated with the preparation and consumption of food, and the cultural elements associated with menus, dining schedules, and food consumption (e.g., Kosher, Hallal, vegan/vegetarian, etc.) Food preparation and dining are often social experiences that reflect culture and other expectations for cooperation and sharing of both food and conversation, as well as engagement in a variety of behaviors directly associated with eating, such as use of specific utensils (chopsticks, fork, spoon, hands, etc.), cleanliness, order, and the nature of physical presence (e.g., sitting in a chair, standing, walking, sitting cross-legged on the floor, use of a particular hand, etc.) Appropriate participation in all elements of eating are important for health and happiness.","0.386","Social Communication","0.383","cooperation","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Inadequate Self-Care/Hygiene","not maintaining appropriate cleanliness","Hygiene is a group of practices that are primarily designed to maintain cleanliness and prevention of disease. However, in addition to a health component, there is a strong social component to hygiene that is culturally driven. This includes grooming practices, attire, and general standards of tidiness. To meet the basic health obligations for hygiene requires regular washing and bathing of the body as well as washing clothes. To meet the social obligations of hygiene not only includes cleanliness, but also attending to standards for physical presentation. This includes various elements and depends on culture and environment. Some factors may include the type of clean clothing, cleaning teeth, arranging hair, trimming and painting nails, the use of makeup, management of body odor, etc.","0.599","Toileting Problems","0.554","Daily Self-Care Routines","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Screen Time","managing screen-based activities including education games entertainment and social media","“Screens” refers to devices such as computers, television, tablets, e-readers, smartphones, and hand-held video games.

Screen time has two components: duration and content. While some materials and exposures may be safe and appropriate, other can be quite dangerous.","0.461","Play","0.516","Time Management","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Sleep Disturbance","evidence of inadequate duration or quality of sleep including drowsiness and persistent lack of energy","While the precise function of sleep is unknown, sleep appears to be a physiological state in which the brain rests and resets some of its functions. While the brain is engaged in sleep, the remainder of the human body also gets a chance to rest and recover from the physical exertion of the previous day. Sleep may also play a restorative role for physiologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning and wellbeing. Sleep has discrete stages, one of which allows for dreaming. Typically, individuals sleep varying amounts of time, ranging from 4-10 hours, usually, but not necessarily occurring at night. Daytime napping may also be a healthy component of sleep. One goal for sleep is to gain adequate amounts of rest to support ongoing activities during the waking hours. Pre-bedtime and bedtime routines are commonly associated with sleep, and may include social activities (e.g., story telling, prayers, reading, etc.). Sleep difficulties include either inadequate or excessive amounts of sleep, as well as excessive and inappropriate daytime drowsiness.","0.384","Morning Routine","0.631","Sleep-Related Concerns","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Substance Use","using inappropriate substances including alcohol tobacco and cannabis","Substance use is the consumption of chemicals that disrupt cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning. The most common substance use is alcohol and nicotine, but can also include a broad variety of substances, including the inappropriate use of prescribed medications. Persistent use of substances that leads to disruption in function is referred to as substance abuse. It is said that for some individuals, the recreational use of some substances may be acceptable, however, it is not clear who can safely use which substances. All evidence suggests that even the most benign of these medications and substances that are used inappropriately can have both short- and long-term disruptions in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning, even modest doses, and may also be associated with significant general health complications. Addiction is a subset of substance abuse that is characterized by habitual, often uncontrollable use of substances, and a “withdrawal syndrome” when the substances are discontinued.","0.3","Physically or Emotionally Harms Others","0.337","self-control","No","No"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Toileting Problems","managing toileting behaviors and routines","Managing toileting and hygiene is a basic social and behavioral skill that is essential for successful adaptive function. It includes self-management of excretions, as well as cleaning oneself. Intrinsic to managing toileting and hygiene, is a personal understanding of one’s own daily rhythms and the extent to which one can control them, in the context of other environmental events (e.g., school/work, leisure, sleep, meals etc.). Therefore successful toileting and hygiene includes proper scheduling and the use of socially-appropriate behaviors to complete toileting and hygiene tasks.","0.599","Inadequate Self-Care/Hygiene","0.536","Daily Self-Care Routines","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","General Well-Being","Trauma History","having directly or indirectly experienced traumatic events","In the course of typical, daily life, there are events of varying intensity that cause emotional or physical pain or disturbance (e.g., injury or death of a loved one). While upsetting and possibly causing “trauma-related symptoms,” they are not likely to lead to a trauma diagnosis. These symptoms generally resolve quickly and without long-term impact. On occasion, depending on the individual and the nature of the events, symptoms may persist. And, even more rarely, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), may appear. Severe traumatic reactions are generally associated with events in which the individual’s health safety and/or life are in immediate jeopardy. Individuals are more likely to be affected the closer they are in time and space to traumatic events.","0.34","Memory/Recall","0.376","resilience","No","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Interacting with Others","Attachment","having attachments to family peers and adults","Attachment is the strong, bilateral, emotional connection between humans (and other animals).

"FACETS-60","Interacting with Others","Play","playing well alone and with others","Play is a complex set of behaviors, largely for the purpose of enjoyment, but may also provide a tool for experimentation and problem-solving in a safe or non-competitive environment. Play activities include social and imaginary use of objects and relationships as well as opportunities to practice a full spectrum of social skills, behavioral control, problem solving and much more. The complexity and function of play develops along with the development of cognitive and motor function, routines and habits, knowledge and skills, and much more. Play takes place in individual and social contexts. It may include games and toys, as well as tools and tasks typically a part of daily work (e.g., pencils, cooking utensils, sports equipment, etc.). While these playful interactions may seem to be of little purpose, they are actually serious attempts at mastery, role-playing, and practice that sets the stage for real-life skills and activities. This actual nature of the practice varies as a result of a variety of factors including context, social relationships, and developmental age.","0.518","Social Cooperation","0.547","initiative and curiosity","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Interacting with Others","Social Communication","communication enabling social interactions","Social functioning is the ability to share thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors. Social communication includes words and gestures in conjunction with an “invitation” to respond, as well as the willingness to receive and accept social responses. This leads to reciprocity, or “turn-taking,” the repeated exchanges of thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors that form the basis of conversation, discussion, collaborative work, and play.","0.668","Social Cooperation","0.757","communication","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Interacting with Others","Social Cooperation","cooperating in social interactions including play","Cooperation is working together with other individuals, or in groups, to achieve a common goal or objective.

"FACETS-60","Interacting with Others","Responsibility for Self & Others","accepting responsibility for actions taken by self or others","Responsibility is the willingness and ability to appropriately manage or control self, situations and/or the actions of other individuals. The ability to assume responsibility begins with managing one’s own actions, emotions, and cognitions, then gradually expands to being more in control of interactions with others and broader elements of the environment. When faced with new tasks or uncertainty, there may be cautionary over-control followed by fading to a balance between self-control and sharing control with others.","0.561","Self-Control","0.776","responsibility","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction","Abstract Thinking","understanding and applying abstract concepts such as analogies and metaphors","Abstraction is the ability to think flexibly about ideas rather than just concrete circumstances, including words and events. The ability to engage in abstract thinking is essential to many forms of human expression, including mathematics, science, literature, play, humor etc. Abstract thinking includes skills such as the ability to think about numbers without having something to count, and to play “make-believe” or to tell an imaginary story (e.g., fairy tales). Without abstract thinking, it is difficult to expand thoughts and ideas beyond the concrete objects, limiting creative problem-solving.","0.415","Thinking Speed","0.493","thinking about our thinking (metacognition)","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction","Creativity","applying novel strategies to problem-solving","Creativity is the ability to see beyond traditionals constraints and rules, and to allow imagination as well as novel and unique ideas to help solve new problems, offer alternative solutions to existing tasks or problems, and provide unique perspectives on the many aspects of our daily lives.","0.402","Thinking Speed","0.869","creativity","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction","Distorted Perceptions of Reality","inappropriate or inaccurate interpretation of events experiences and thoughts","Perception of reality, or “reality testing,” is the ability to consistently discern the difference between facts and fantasy or other imagined thought content and perceptions. While each of us may have a vivid imagination and fantasies, except under extraordinary circumstances, we can readily distinguish between reality and that which we imagine. The extraordinary circumstances under which clearly recognizing reality may be impaired, include: extreme stress, during intense grief, when very defensive, and when engaged in intense play or similar activity. In these latter cases, the difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy/imagination is usually short-lived and quite specific to the circumstances (e.g., seeing visions of the presence of a recently deceased person). Specific difficulties associated with problems in reality perception include: hallucination (i.e., hearing, seeing, feeling or other sensation in the absence or an actual stimulus), delusion (i.e., a false belief), illusion (i.e., gross misperception of an actual stimulus), etc.","0.328","Trauma History","0.383","attending to our shared reality with others","No","Yes"

"FACETS-60","Motor Skills","Gross Motor Skills","performing the full spectrum of gross motor activities","Gross motor skills are generally large amplitude motor movements, most commonly the product of the larger muscle groups of the limbs and trunk. Since there are many muscle groups involved in gross motor activity they must be coordinated to be effective. The coordination includes input from the kinesthetic, visual, and somatosensory systems, as well as practice for complex tasks, including walking. Skilled gross motor activity sets the stage for success in many areas including athletics, dance, cycling, driving etc.","0.799","Fine Motor Skills","0.531","physical skills","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Motor Skills","Tics and Atypical Movements","adapting social and other behaviors in response to tics or atypical movements","Tics (repetitive motor behaviors), as well as disruptions in motor rhythm and coordination fluidity constitute atypical movements. Atypical movements may include fine or gross motor activity, involve very rapid to very slow movements, and have varying size of movements. Tics may involve facial muscles (e.g., twitching), trunk and limb muscle movements (e.g., head and shoulder shrugging), as well vocal tics (i.e., respiratory and laryngeal muscle movements yielding either sounds or words.) Atypical movements often make affected individuals feel sad, embarrassed, frustrated, and anxious; they often become victims of mockery, shaming, and bullying.","0.389","Fine Motor Skills","0.481","Physical Restlessness","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Organization & Planning","Attention/Concentration","sustaining attention and concentration","Attention is the ability to focus interests, cognition, emotions and/or other resources on a particular object, goal, idea, effort, activity, etc. Attention and concentration are cognitive processes that allow for the selection and focus on a particular task or object (including goals, ideas, etc.) for some period of time. It is usually easier to pay attention when there is strong interest, feeling or commitment to a particular topic or goal. Concentration and attention can vary by environment and other concomitant obligations. Most children and adults can maintain concentration on an important topic for 30-40 minutes. Attention and concentration often require active avoidance of distraction.

"FACETS-60","Organization & Planning","Memory/Recall","expending effort and employing strategies for remembering and recalling","Memory is a complex biological function that allows for the brain to store and recall factual information and related emotional and other factors that are linked to the facts. There are multiple forms of memory to account for different uses of the stored information. Short-term memory is for the management of information that is needed temporarily to complete a brief task. For intermediate level activities, information from short-term memory is transferred to working memory for more extended task completion. Long-term memory is information that may be used again and again and/or over extended periods of time. The durability of a particular memory depends a great deal on the importance of that which is being remembered, the linkages of that memory to other important factors (i.e., emotions, location, sensory associations, other memories, etc.), repetition of the memory over the course of time, and distractions or disruptions when the memory is being stored.","0.414","Attention/Concentration","0.636","working memory","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Organization & Planning","Planning and Organization","developing plans to complete tasks","Planning and organization, often referred to as “executive functions,” make it possible to allocate cognitive and other resources to successfully sequence and complete tasks. Planning and organization are learned skills that require the appropriate application of attention, cognitive ability, and memoryin order to create and sustain a plan. This includes both short-term and long-term planning for projects, assignments, and other activities. It also includes the monitoring of these processes and plans in order to assure progress toward the desired goal. While younger children have difficulty with executive functions due to a limited concept of time, with maturity, it is possible to manage more and multiple complex tasks, with intermixed goals and objectives.","0.465","Thinking Speed","0.704","planning","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Organization & Planning","Task Completion","recognizing beginning structure and end of tasks","It is typical to spontaneously take on tasks and willingly accept task assignments. Task completion is the ability to appreciate that all tasks have beginnings and ends, while also finding satisfaction in moving to and achieving a goal. Without fear, one recognizes that failure and/or inability to complete the task sometimes occurs. Managing failure and other disruptions is critical to consistent task completion, even in the face of potential disappointment.","0.401","Planning and Organization","0.843","Task Completion","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Organization & Planning","Thinking Speed","adapting thinking speed to meet situational demands","The pace of adaptive thinking varies to meet the demands of the task. Multiple factors contribute to the enormous variation in thinking speed as individuals process information, including attention, intellectual ability, interests, familiarity, and memory, as well as environment and practice. It is important to manage thinking speed in order to allocate flexible amounts of time to appropriately address varying problems and challenges. Thinking faster is not always helpful as it may lead to errors, whereas thinking slowly may lead to missed opportunities. Finding successful balance in regulating thinking speed is essential for successful adaptation.","0.465","Planning and Organization","0.606","thinking about our thinking (metacognition)","Yes","Yes"
"FACETS-60","Receptive Communication","Receptive Language","recognizing and understanding words and gestures as communication","Receptive language is the capacity to comprehend verbal and non-verbal messages provided by others in the environment. It requires the ability to appreciate the nuances of communication (e.g., gesture, body posture, rhythm, volume, vocabulary, prosody, tone, etc.); each of these elements enhance the effectiveness and comprehension of communicative intent. In order to receive communication, the individual must attend to the critical elements of language, as well as the ability to focus on and interpret communication directed specifically at the individual, as well as more broadly with the environment. These skills grow in complexity over the course of the lifespan, however, there is considerable variability amongst individuals that depends on their biological make-up, cognitive ability, culture, and social experience.","0.645","Expressive Language","0.785","Receptive Communication","Yes","Yes"

"FACETS-60","Sense of Self","Sexual/Gender Identity and Behavior","expressing age-appropriate sexual identity and behavior","Sexual behavior includes behaviors that are related to an individual's particular individual “sexual identity.” While there are generally male and female biological differences amongst humans, there exists a broad spectrum of gender-related behaviors that are “assigned” or “learned,” based on cultural and social expectations in a community, not infrequently independent of “sex assigned at birth.” Some behaviors appear to be “assigned,” and are often considered “conventional.” When there are variations that don’t meet social expectations, it can cause discomfort - for children, peers, and/or adults - and can lead to adverse outcomes like bullying, discrimination and social isolation. Examples of these are so-called “effeminate” males or “masculine” females. Most “unconventional” gender behaviors are not abnormal but simply represent the broad variation in expressions of identity.","0.352","Play","0.45","Peer Relationships","Yes","Yes"

They intentionally form a vision of a product, plan of action, goal or a destination before they begin. They strive to clarify and understand directions, develop a strategy for approaching a problem and withhold immediate value judgments about an idea before fully understanding it. Reflective individuals consider alternatives and consequences of several possible directions prior to taking action. They decrease their need for trial and error by gathering information, taking time to reflect on an answer before giving it, making sure they understand directions, and listening to alternative points of view. Often students blurt the first answer that comes to mind. Sometimes they shout out an answer, start to work without fully understanding the directions, lack an organized plan or strategy for approaching a problem or make immediate value judgments about an idea—criticizing or praising it— before fully understanding it.","","0.571","Thinking Speed","0.683","problem-solving","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","listening to others with understanding and empathy","Highly effective people spend an inordinate amount of time and energy listening (Covey, 1989). Some psychologists believe that the ability to listen to another person, to empathize with, and to understand their point of view is one of the highest forms of intelligent behavior. Being able to paraphrase another person's ideas, detecting indicators (cues) of their feelings or emotional states in their oral and body language (empathy), accurately expressing another person's concepts, emotions and problems—all are indications of listening behavior (Piaget called it ""overcoming ego-centrism""). They are able to see through the diverse perspectives of others. They gently attend to another person demonstrating their understanding of and empathy for an idea or feeling by paraphrasing it accurately, building upon it, clarifying it, or giving an example of it.","","0.62","Empathy","0.721","empathy building","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","thinking flexibly","An amazing discovery about the human brain is its plasticity--its ability to ""rewire"", change and even repair itself to become smarter. Flexible people are the ones with the most control. They have the capacity to change their mind as they receive additional data. They engage in multiple and simultaneous outcomes and activities, draw upon a repertoire of problem solving strategies and can practice style flexibility, knowing when it is appropriate to be broad and global in their thinking and when a situation requires detailed precision. They create and seek novel approaches and have a well-developed sense of humor. They envision a range of consequences. Flexible people can approach a problem from a new angle using a novel approach {deBono (1970) refers to this as lateral thinking.} They consider alternative points of view or deal with several sources of information simultaneously. Their minds are open to change based on additional information and data or reasoning, which contradicts their beliefs. Flexible people know that they have and can develop options and alternatives to consider. They understand mean-ends relationships being able to work within rules, criteria and regulations and they can predict the consequences of flouting them. They understand not only the immediate reactions but are also able to perceive the bigger purposes that such constraints serve. Thus, flexibility of mind is essential for working with social diversity, enabling an individual to recognize the wholeness and distinctness of other people's ways of experiencing and making meaning. Flexible thinkers are able to shift, at will, through multiple perceptual positions. One perceptual orientation is what Jean Piaget called, egocentrism--perceiving from our own point of view. By contrast, allocentrism is the position in which we perceive through another persons' orientation. We operate from this second position when we empathize with other's feelings, predict how others are thinking, and anticipate potential misunderstandings. Flexible thinkers display confidence in their intuition. They tolerate confusion and ambiguity up to a point, and are willing to let go of a problem trusting their subconscious to continue creative and productive work on it. Flexibility is the cradle of humor, creativity and repertoire. While there are many possible perceptual positions--past, present, future, egocentric, allocentric, macro centric, visual, auditory, kinesthetic--the flexible mind is activated by knowing when to shift perceptual positions.","","0.587","Thinking Speed","0.766","Thinking Flexibility","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","thinking about our thinking (metacognition)","Occurring in the neocortex, metacognition is our ability to know what we know and what we don't know. It is our ability to plan a strategy for producing what information is needed, to be conscious of our own steps and strategies during the act of problem solving, and to reflect on and evaluate the productiveness of our own thinking. While ""inner language,"" thought to be a prerequisite, begins in most children around age five, metacognition is a key attribute of formal thought flowering about age eleven. Probably the major components of metacognition are developing a plan of action, maintaining that plan in mind over a period of time, then reflecting back on and evaluating the plan upon its completion. Planning a strategy before embarking on a course of action assists us in keeping track of the steps in the sequence of planned behavior at the conscious awareness level for the duration of the activity. It facilitates making temporal and comparative judgments, assessing the readiness for more or different activities, and monitoring our interpretations, perceptions, decisions and behaviors. An example of this would be what superior teachers do daily: developing a teaching strategy for a lesson, keeping that strategy in mind throughout the instruction, then reflecting back upon the strategy to evaluate its effectiveness in producing the desired student outcomes. Intelligent people plan for, reflect on, and evaluate the quality of their own thinking skills and strategies. Metacognition means becoming increasingly aware of one's actions and the effect of those actions on others and on the environment; forming internal questions as one searches for information and meaning, developing mental maps or plans of action, mentally rehearsing prior to performance, monitoring those plans as they are employed--being conscious of the need for midcourse correction if the plan is not meeting expectations, reflecting on the plan upon completion of the implementation for the purpose of self-evaluation, and editing mental pictures for improved performance.","","0.606","Thinking Speed","0.819","thinking and metacognition","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","striving for accuracy and precision","Embodied in the stamina, grace and elegance of a ballerina or a shoemaker, is the desire for craftsmanship, mastery, flawlessness and economy of energy to produce exceptional results. People who value accuracy, precision and craftsmanship take time to check over their products. They review the rules by which they are to abide; they review the models and visions they are to follow; and they review the criteria they are to employ and confirm that their finish product matches the criteria exactly. To be craftsmanlike means knowing that one can continually perfect one's craft by working to attain the highest possible standards, and pursue ongoing learning in order to bring a laser like focus of energies to task accomplishment. These people take pride in their work and have a desire for accuracy as they take time to check over their work. Craftsmanship includes exactness, precision, accuracy, correctness, faithfulness, and fidelity. For some people, craftsmanship requires continuous reworking.

Effective problem solvers know how to ask questions to fill in the gaps between what they know and what they don't know. Effective questioners are inclined to ask a range of questions. For example: requests for data to support others' conclusions and assumptions—such questions as, ""What evidence do you have.....?"" ""How do you know that's true?"" ""How reliable is this data source?"" They pose questions about alternative points of view: ""From whose viewpoint are we seeing, reading of hearing?"" ""From what angle, what perspective are we viewing this situation?"" Students pose questions, which make causal connections and relationships: ""How are these people (events) (situations) related to each other?"" ""What produced this connection?""

They explain what they are doing now in terms of analogies with or references to previous experiences. They call upon their store of knowledge and experience as sources of data to support, theories to explain, or processes to solve each new challenge. Furthermore, they are able to abstract meaning from one experience, carry it forth, and apply it in a new and novel situation.

Creative human beings try to conceive problem solutions differently, examining alternative possibilities from many angles. They tend to project themselves into different roles using analogies, starting with a vision and working backward, imagining they are the objects being considered. Creative people take risks and frequently push the boundaries of their perceived limits (Perkins 1985). They are intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated, working on the task because of the aesthetic challenge rather than the material rewards. Creative people are open to criticism. They hold up their products for others to judge and seek feedback in an ever-increasing effort to refine their technique. They are uneasy with the status quo.

They seek problems to solve for themselves and to submit to others. They delight in making up problems to solve on their own and request enigmas from others. They enjoy figuring things out by themselves, and continue to learn throughout their lifetimes. We want our students, however to be curious; to commune with the world around them; to reflect on the changing formations of a cloud; feel charmed by the opening of a bud; sense the logical simplicity of mathematical order. Students can find beauty in a sunset, intrigue in the geometric of a spider web, and exhilaration at the iridescence of a hummingbird's wings. They see the congruity and intricacies in the derivation of a mathematical formula, recognize the orderliness and adroitness of a chemical change, and commune with the serenity of a distant constellation.

"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","taking responsible risks","Flexible people seem to have an almost uncontrollable urge to go beyond established limits. They are uneasy about comfort; they ""live on the edge of their competence"". They seem compelled to place themselves in situations where they do not know what the outcome will be. They accept confusion, uncertainty, and the higher risks of failure as part of the normal process and they learn to view setbacks as interesting, challenging and growth producing. However, they are not behaving impulsively. Their risks are educated. They draw on past knowledge, are thoughtful about consequences and have a well-trained sense of what is appropriate. They know that all risks are not worth taking! Risk taking can be considered in two categories: those who see it as a venture and those who see it as adventure. The venture part of risk taking might be described by the venture capitalist. When a person is approached to take the risk of investing in a new business, she will look at the markets, see how well organized the ideas are, and study the economic projections. If she finally decides to take the risk, it is a well considered one.The adventure part of risk taking might be described by the experiences from project adventure. In this situation, there is a spontaneity, a willingness to take a chance in the moment. Once again, a person will only take the chance if they know that there is either past history that suggests that what they are doing is not going to be life threatening or if they believe that there is enough support in the group to protect them from harm. Ultimately, the learning from such high-risk experiences is that people are far more able to take actions than they previously believed. It is only through repeated experiences that risk taking becomes educated. It often is a cross between intuition, drawing on past knowledge and a sense of meeting new challenges. Bobby Jindal, executive Director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare states, “The only way to succeed is to be brave enough to risk failure. “ (Briggs, 1999 p 2A) When someone holds back from taking risks, he is confronted constantly with missed opportunities. Some students seem reluctant to take risks. Some students hold back games, new learning, and new friendships because their fear of failure is far greater than their experience of venture or adventure. They are reinforced by the mental voice that says, “ if you don’t try it, you won’t be wrong” or “if you try it and you are wrong, you will look stupid”. The other voice that might say, “if you don’t try it, you will never know” is trapped in fear and mistrust. They are more interested in knowing whether their answer is correct or not, rather than being challenged by the process of finding the answer. They are unable to sustain a process of problem solving and finding the answer over time, and therefore avoid ambiguous situations. They have a need for certainty rather than an inclination for doubt. We hope that students will learn how to take intellectual as well as physical risks. Students who are capable of being different, going against the grain of the common, thinking of new ideas and testing them with peers as well as teachers, are more likely to be successful in this age of innovation and uncertainty.","","0.692","Risk Taking","0.722","risk-takers","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","finding humor","Another unique attribute of human beings is our sense of humor. Laughter transcends all human beings. Its’ positive effects on psychological functions include a drop in the pulse rate, the secretion of endorphins, an increased oxygen in the blood. It has been found to liberate creativity and provoke such higher level thinking skills as anticipation, finding novel relationships, visual imagery, and making analogies. People who engage in the mystery of humor have the ability to perceive situations from an original and often interesting vantagepoint. They tend to initiate humor more often, to place greater value on having a sense of humor, to appreciate and understand others' humor and to be verbally playful when interacting with others. Having a whimsical frame of mind, they thrive on finding incongruity and perceiving absurdities, ironies and satire; finding discontinuities and being able to laugh at situations and themselves. Some students find humor in all the ""wrong places""--human differences, ineptitude, injurious behavior, vulgarity, violence and profanity. They laugh at others yet are unable to laugh at themselves. We want our student to acquire the characteristic of creative problem solvers, they can distinguish between situations of human frailty and fallibility which are in need of compassion and those which are truly funny.

"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","thinking interdependently","Human beings are social beings. We congregate in groups, find it therapeutic to be listened to, draw energy from one another, and seek reciprocity. In groups we contribute our time and energy to tasks that we would quickly tire of when working alone. In fact, we have learned that one of the cruelest forms of punishment that can be inflicted on an individual is solitary confinement. Cooperative humans realize that all of us together are more powerful, intellectually and/or physically, than any one individual. Probably the foremost disposition in the post industrial society is the heightened ability to think in concert with others; to find ourselves increasingly more interdependent and sensitive to the needs of others. Problem solving has become so complex that no one person can go it alone. No one has access to all the data needed to make critical decisions; no one person can consider as many alternatives as several people can. Some students may not have learned to work in groups; they have underdeveloped social skills. They feel isolated, they prefer their solitude. ""Leave me alone--I'll do it by my self"". "" They just don't like me"". ""I want to be alone."" Some students seem unable to contribute to group work either by being a ""job hog"" or conversely, letting others do all the work. Working in groups requires the ability to justify ideas and to test the feasibility of solution strategies on others. It also requires the development of a willingness and openness to accept the feedback from a critical friend. Through this interaction the group and the individual continue to grow. Listening, consensus seeking, giving up an idea to work with someone else's, empathy, compassion, group leadership, knowing how to support group efforts, altruism--all are behaviors indicative of cooperative human beings.","","0.531","Social Cooperation","0.75","Cooperation","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","Habits of Mind","learning continuously","Intelligent people are in a continuous learning mode. Their confidence, in combination with their inquisitiveness, allows them to constantly search for new and better ways. People with this Habit of Mind are always striving for improvement, always growing, always learning, always modifying and improving themselves. They seize problems, situations, tensions, conflicts and circumstances as valuable opportunities to learn. A great mystery about humans is that we confront learning opportunities with fear rather than mystery and wonder. We seem to feel better when we know rather than when we learn. We defend our biases, beliefs, and storehouses of knowledge rather than inviting the unknown, the creative and the inspirational. Being certain and closed gives us comfort while being doubtful and open gives us fear. From an early age, employing a curriculum of fragmentation, competition and reactiveness, students are trained to believe that deep learning means figuring out the truth rather than developing capabilities for effective and thoughtful action. They have been taught to value certainty rather than doubt, to give answers rather than to inquire, to know which choice is correct rather than to explore alternatives. Our wish is for creative students and people who are eager to learn. That includes the humility of knowing that we don't know, which is the highest form of thinking we will ever learn. Paradoxically, unless you start off with humility you will never get anywhere, so as the first step you have to have already what will eventually be the crowning glory of all learning: the humility to know--and admit--that you don't know and not be afraid to find out.","","0.482","Thinking Speed","0.606","responding with wonderment and awe","Yes","Yes"

"Frameworks","MELQO MODEL Framework","working memory","Working memory is defined as the ability to store and mentally manipulate memory contents (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974; Davidson et al., 2006). Working memory is positively related to general intellectual functioning, mathematics and reading comprehension (Monette et al., 2011; Passolunghi et al., 2007; Swanson and Jerman, 2007; Lesaux et al., 2007). Issues with working memory are associated with difficulty following multistep directions, forgetfulness and inattention (Bignell and Cain, 2007; Engle et al., 1991; Gathercole et al., 2006). Verbal working memory is a weak but significant predictor of attentional ability in everyday activities, such as remembering long sentences and phone numbers (Groth-Marnat and Baker, 2003). Working memory is similarly important for learning, and may be closely related to inhibitory control. In young children (2 to 6 years old), measures of working memory and inhibitory control are strongly related to one another and can be assessed using the same tasks (Wiebe et al., 2008).","","0.636","Memory/Recall","0.709","working memory and meta-cognition","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","MELQO MODEL Framework","inhibitory control","Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress the processing of irrelevant yet dominant stimuli or responses (Nigg, 2000). Inhibitory control, along with flexible switching, has been identified as one of the first executive function skills to emerge, developing quickly during the pre-school years (Diamond and Doar, 1989; Diamond et al., 2002). Inhibitory control skills help children suppress inappropriate behaviours and thoughts that may distract them from instruction (Alexander et al., 1993; Blair, 2002; Sa?ez et al. 2012). Further, these skills are essential for cognition, educational attainment and social functioning (Blair, 2002; Espy et al., 2004). Measured prior to kindergarten, inhibitory control predicts mathematics skills in kindergarten; when measured in kindergarten, it predicts mathematics and early literacy skills in primary school (Blair and Razza, 2007).","","0.607","Self-Control","0.711","control","Yes","Yes"

Social cognition encompasses empathy – children’s abilities to read others’ emotions and respond appropriately – as well as prosocial behaviour that includes helping others who may be in distress. Understanding the feelings of oneself and others includes the ability to (1) comprehend basic emotions (e.g. happiness, sadness and anger) and how these emotions are expressed, as well as their antecedents, causes and consequences; (2) recognize that emotions are complex (e.g. two individuals can feel two different emotions in response to the same event); and (3) distinguish rules for how to display basic and more complex emotions (e.g. shame or guilt).

"Frameworks","Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning","initiative and curiosity","A desire to explore a range of topics, eagerly engage in activities, think and play creatively, and learn independently. Show an interest in learning. Learning begins with curiosity as children show an interest in learning and talking about a range of topics, ideas, and tasks (i.e., ask questions and seek new information). Show self-confidence in approaching new challenges. Children are open to learning more things when they have confidence in their abilities and are empowered to take on new challenges and experiences while developing new skills. Think and play imaginatively. Children learn through play. Their imagination paves the way for flexible thinking as they think beyond their immediate reality while playing alone or with others (e.g., fly like a butterfly). Think creatively and symbolically. Problem solving requires creative thinking and can also require the use of symbols to represent things beyond the here and now. Children learn these skills as they explore divergent uses of an object (e.g., use a table as a “tent”) and use one thing to represent another in play (e.g., line up chairs to be a “bus”).","","0.547","Play","0.691","Curiosity","Yes","Yes"

Maintain focused attention. Children learn to resist distractions and instead use self-control to maintain focused attention. Persist at tasks. Children show self-control by stopping impulsive actions and reactions, and they learn to persist at tasks, sometimes delaying gratification or resisting distractions to continue the task at hand through frustration or challenges (e.g., getting dressed in the morning). If needed, they may break the task into smaller, more manageable components. Think flexibly. Children learn to think flexibly about a problem or situation by switching rules, doing the opposite, thinking about someone else’s perspective, applying different strategies or transitioning from one activity to another.

Children learn more about things by observing how certain characteristics are similar or different (e.g., color, shape, size, texture, or sound), and they classify, match, and sort objects based on those characteristics (e.g., putting all the blue objects into one group). Consider and choose from multiple solutions or options. Children learn to investigate multiple solutions or options to solve a problem. They think critically about each one and evaluate it, then choose the most appropriate or effective solution. Evaluate their choice. Children learn to reflect on the solution or decision they made and decide whether or not it was successful.

Children learn to cope with and manage strong feelings appropriately. They become aware of clues inside their bodies to tell the difference between comfortable and uncomfortable feelings. They learn to use calming down strategies such as belly breathing to work through uncomfortable feelings in stressful or emotional situations. Regulate their behavior. Children control themselves in stressful and emotional situations. They may use self-regulation strategies such as self-talk, counting, or singing. Demonstrates self-control.

"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","problem solving","Problem Solving includes a range of discrete skills related to how individuals solve social problems. These skills are associated with specific facets of Conscientiousness. Much of the developmental and intervention work on social problem solving29 has emphasized an array of interconnected social information-processing skills30 individuals use when solving social problems (e.g., joining a group, resolving conflicts). These include attention to relevant cues, interpretation of cues and emotional reactions, goal setting and planning, access to behavioral responses from memory, evaluation of responses, decision making, behavioral enactment, and reflection (Crick & Dodge, 1994). Through socialization, direct instruction, and cultural influences, individuals develop relatively stable patterns of processing social (and non-social) information.","","0.512","Social Communication","0.758","problem-solving","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","resilience","Resilience has been defined as the ability to “bounce back” from adversity and thrive in the context of risk. Resilience refers to a pattern over time that is characterized by good eventual adaptation despite risk, stressors, or adversity. It also is defined by the ability to appropriately and realistically connect future goals and opportunities to one’s own abilities, and to adapt as needed to situational constraints. Resilient individuals cope well with stressors and do not get derailed by stressful events but persist and remain optimistic. Although there are individual differences in stress tolerance, resilience generally is a learned process that is facilitated through positive and supportive interactions with the environment. Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism are two of the Big Five traits that align with resilience, along with Grit, but it is the expression of these traits under difficult circumstances that is the defining feature of resilience.","","0.508","Perseverance","0.895","Resilience","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","achievement motivation","Achievement Motivation includes an orientation towards success, mastery, and sense of purpose. It has been associated with the capacity and drive to pursue difficult tasks, to work toward desired goals, and a high degree of independence. Individuals who are high in achievement motivation will demonstrate both a desire to learn and a focus on mastery as well as (or even more than) performance goals. They view learning skills and intelligence as an effortful, incremental process that can be improved rather than an inherited trait that is relatively stable over time. In terms of personality traits, it is most closely aligned with Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience as well as the construct of Grit.","","0.716","Academic Motivation","0.777","achievement motivation","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","control","Control (self-control) includes a range of self-regulatory skills that are evident when individuals are able to modulate and restrain their impulses or immediate reactions to stimuli. Control skills such as the ability to effectively focus attention, delay gratification, and inhibit impulsive responding are crucial for early academic achievement and have been linked to later adjustment, educational, and occupational success. They also are important for problem solving, as they allow individuals to “stop and think” before acting and respond in a controlled rather than automatic fashion. Control is related to the concept of delay discounting in that low levels of impulse control are linked to higher levels of discounting future rewards. Self-control is an important skill complement to Conscientiousness.","","0.796","Self-Control","0.766","self-control","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","teamwork","Teamwork refers broadly to a set of skills involved in getting along with others, understanding their feelings and points of view, communicating effectively, being helpful and agreeable, and not engaging in aggressive or bullying behaviors. In the social-emotional domain it has been defined more regularly as “relationship skills” that enable individuals to get along with and work effectively with others, including people from diverse cultures. Teamwork is highest among individuals who score high on personality traits of Extraversion and Agreeableness.","","0.5","Social Cooperation","0.81","teamwork and collaboration","Yes","Yes"
"Frameworks","The PRACTICE Model","initiative","Initiative can be conceptualized as the “active ingredient” that motivates individuals to operate as positive and successful actors in their own lives and in systems. Initiative hinges on personal agency31 and an internal locus of control, a belief that outcomes depend on one’s own actions rather than fate, chance, or others. It is linked to enterprise, taking charge, follow-through, determination, and leadership. It also facilitates effective engagement within organizational contexts. Although initiative and achievement motivation are related, they are distinct skills. Initiative relates to any type of “take charge” action such as picking up litter on the street, whereas achievement motivation is linked to a desire to succeed and is associated with setting long-term academic and career goals and following this pursuit in spite of obstacles that may occur along the way. Initiative correlates with mastery orientation to achievement and relates to the personality traits of Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness.","","0.494","Academic Motivation","0.811","initiative","Yes","Yes"

There is considerable debate as to whether there are universal ethical values or whether ethics are relativistic or dependent on cultural norms. Still, in terms of labor market outcomes, it is possible to identify specific and more universally-accepted and relevant skills linked to honesty, following rules, following through on actions, fairness, and acting in a responsible manner. Clearly, society and employers require trustworthy citizens who follow cultural rules and norms. For example, GED-earning adults contribute less to the economy than high-school graduates, a pattern that is not attributable to differences in academic competence. Instead, GED earners may be less proficient in adhering to ethical, context-suitable behavior, because they missed opportunities to acquire these skills from school social interactions (Heckman & Rubinstein, 2001).

In conjunction with critical thinking and problem-solving skills, to which it closely relates, creativity is a major component of purposeful thinking, i.e., a non-chaotic, orderly and organized thought process. Further, being creative is to a large extent connected to the learners’ cognitive abilities, including their analytic and evaluative skills (Sternberg, 2006). Ideational thought processes are fundamental to creative persons (Kozbelt et al., 2010), but creativity also intersects with social and personal management skills. Therefore, creativity, while also related to the arts, is a pre-condition to innovation and adaptive behaviours and solutions in all life settings, among them in learning settings and in the workplace (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2015).

Another essential aspect of purposeful thinking, problem-solving is a high-order thinking process inter-related with other important life skills, such as critical thinking, analytical thinking, decision-making and creativity. More specifically, being able to solve problems implies a process of planning, i.e., the formulation of a method to attain the desired goal. Problem-solving begins with recognizing that a problematic situation exists and establishing an understanding of the nature of the situation.

Decision-making is used by all individuals on a daily basis, as they are regularly faced with situations in which they have to make a judgement about how best to proceed, and also when it is most appropriate to do so.

Because it is highly contextualized, ‘being resilient’ will have different levels of depth for the individual developing and/or displaying that core life skill, especially in MENA. In all cases, however, the life skill of resilience shall be understood, in general terms, as the constructive, personal ability to navigate changing circumstances successfully (American Psychological Association, 2010), thus beyond the restrictive understanding, according to which resilience is constrained to the capacity to survive, accept or resign oneself to an unacceptable situation.","","0.451","Perseverance","0.803","resilience","Yes","Yes"

It is based on the understanding developed by moral philosophers that acknowledges that human beings are equal participants in a common ethical world by virtue of their human status (Janoff-Bulmann et al., 2008). In this composite life skill, the concept of diversity means understanding that each individual is unique and recognizing each other’s individual differences. These can be defined along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other characteristics. Respect for diversity thus implies more than just tolerance, which is related to accepting differences passively, it means acknowledging and promoting the equal worth of peoples, without condescension (UNICEF, 2007b).","","0.49","Tolerance","0.722","appreciating diversity and difference","Yes","Yes"

A key construct in social and developmental psychology as well as in cognitive and social neuroscience, the ability to empathize is important for promoting positive behaviours toward others, and facilitating social interactions and relationships. Empathy is involved in the internalization of rules that can play a part in protecting others, and, it may be the mechanism that motivates the desire to help others, even at a cost to oneself. In addition, empathy plays an important role in becoming a socially competent person with meaningful social relationships (McDonald and Messinger, 2012). Consequently, empathy motivates altruistic behaviour and has the potential to enhance the process by which rights are realized, which is as important as an outcome (Jönsson and Hall, 2003).","","0.845","Empathy","0.854","empathy","Yes","Yes"

Therefore, both a contextualized process as well as a core life skill, participation is an action of empowerment in relation to the individual and the community. Consequently, being participative, which is interlinked with to the core life skill of creativity, is the contrary to remaining passive at school, at work, and, above all, in society.

In the violence prevention and psychology literature, a distinction between two important aspects of self-control is emphasized: self-control of behavior, and self-control of emotion. Self-control is key for managing impulsivity that is linked with aggression and gang membership.
