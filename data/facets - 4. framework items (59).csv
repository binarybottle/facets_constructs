Habits of Mind,persisting,"Efficacious people stick to a task until it is completed. They don't give up easily. They are able to analyze a problem, to develop a system, structure, or strategy to attack a problem. They employ a range and have repertoire of alternative strategies for problem solving. They collect evidence to indicate their problem-solving strategy is working, and if one strategy doesn't work, they know how to back up and try another. They recognize when a theory or idea must be rejected and another employed. They have systematic methods of analyzing a problem which include knowing how to begin, knowing what steps must be performed, and what data need to be generated or collected. Because they are able to sustain a problem solving process over time, they are comfortable with ambiguous situations."
Habits of Mind,managing impulsivity,"Effective problem solvers have a sense of deliberativeness: They think before they act. They intentionally form a vision of a product, plan of action, goal or a destination before they begin. They strive to clarify and understand directions, develop a strategy for approaching a problem and withhold immediate value judgments about an idea before fully understanding it. Reflective individuals consider alternatives and consequences of several possible directions prior to taking action. They decrease their need for trial and error by gathering information, taking time to reflect on an answer before giving it, making sure they understand directions, and listening to alternative points of view. Often students blurt the first answer that comes to mind. Sometimes they shout out an answer, start to work without fully understanding the directions, lack an organized plan or strategy for approaching a problem or make immediate value judgments about an idea—criticizing or praising it— before fully understanding it."
Habits of Mind,listening to others with understanding and empathy,"Highly effective people spend an inordinate amount of time and energy listening (Covey, 1989). Some psychologists believe that the ability to listen to another person, to empathize with, and to understand their point of view is one of the highest forms of intelligent behavior. Being able to paraphrase another person's ideas, detecting indicators (cues) of their feelings or emotional states in their oral and body language (empathy), accurately expressing another person's concepts, emotions and problems—all are indications of listening behavior (Piaget called it ""overcoming ego-centrism""). They are able to see through the diverse perspectives of others. They gently attend to another person demonstrating their understanding of and empathy for an idea or feeling by paraphrasing it accurately, building upon it, clarifying it, or giving an example of it."
Habits of Mind,thinking flexibly,"An amazing discovery about the human brain is its plasticity--its ability to ""rewire"", change and even repair itself to become smarter. Flexible people are the ones with the most control. They have the capacity to change their mind as they receive additional data. They engage in multiple and simultaneous outcomes and activities, draw upon a repertoire of problem solving strategies and can practice style flexibility, knowing when it is appropriate to be broad and global in their thinking and when a situation requires detailed precision. They create and seek novel approaches and have a well-developed sense of humor. They envision a range of consequences. Flexible people can approach a problem from a new angle using a novel approach {deBono (1970) refers to this as lateral thinking.} They consider alternative points of view or deal with several sources of information simultaneously. Their minds are open to change based on additional information and data or reasoning, which contradicts their beliefs. Flexible people know that they have and can develop options and alternatives to consider. They understand mean-ends relationships being able to work within rules, criteria and regulations and they can predict the consequences of flouting them. They understand not only the immediate reactions but are also able to perceive the bigger purposes that such constraints serve. Thus, flexibility of mind is essential for working with social diversity, enabling an individual to recognize the wholeness and distinctness of other people's ways of experiencing and making meaning. Flexible thinkers are able to shift, at will, through multiple perceptual positions. One perceptual orientation is what Jean Piaget called, egocentrism--perceiving from our own point of view. By contrast, allocentrism is the position in which we perceive through another persons' orientation. We operate from this second position when we empathize with other's feelings, predict how others are thinking, and anticipate potential misunderstandings. Flexible thinkers display confidence in their intuition. They tolerate confusion and ambiguity up to a point, and are willing to let go of a problem trusting their subconscious to continue creative and productive work on it. Flexibility is the cradle of humor, creativity and repertoire. While there are many possible perceptual positions--past, present, future, egocentric, allocentric, macro centric, visual, auditory, kinesthetic--the flexible mind is activated by knowing when to shift perceptual positions."
Habits of Mind,thinking about our thinking (metacognition),"Occurring in the neocortex, metacognition is our ability to know what we know and what we don't know. It is our ability to plan a strategy for producing what information is needed, to be conscious of our own steps and strategies during the act of problem solving, and to reflect on and evaluate the productiveness of our own thinking. While ""inner language,"" thought to be a prerequisite, begins in most children around age five, metacognition is a key attribute of formal thought flowering about age eleven. Probably the major components of metacognition are developing a plan of action, maintaining that plan in mind over a period of time, then reflecting back on and evaluating the plan upon its completion. Planning a strategy before embarking on a course of action assists us in keeping track of the steps in the sequence of planned behavior at the conscious awareness level for the duration of the activity. It facilitates making temporal and comparative judgments, assessing the readiness for more or different activities, and monitoring our interpretations, perceptions, decisions and behaviors. An example of this would be what superior teachers do daily: developing a teaching strategy for a lesson, keeping that strategy in mind throughout the instruction, then reflecting back upon the strategy to evaluate its effectiveness in producing the desired student outcomes. Intelligent people plan for, reflect on, and evaluate the quality of their own thinking skills and strategies. Metacognition means becoming increasingly aware of one's actions and the effect of those actions on others and on the environment; forming internal questions as one searches for information and meaning, developing mental maps or plans of action, mentally rehearsing prior to performance, monitoring those plans as they are employed--being conscious of the need for midcourse correction if the plan is not meeting expectations, reflecting on the plan upon completion of the implementation for the purpose of self-evaluation, and editing mental pictures for improved performance."
Habits of Mind,striving for accuracy and precision,"Embodied in the stamina, grace and elegance of a ballerina or a shoemaker, is the desire for craftsmanship, mastery, flawlessness and economy of energy to produce exceptional results. People who value accuracy, precision and craftsmanship take time to check over their products. They review the rules by which they are to abide; they review the models and visions they are to follow; and they review the criteria they are to employ and confirm that their finish product matches the criteria exactly. To be craftsmanlike means knowing that one can continually perfect one's craft by working to attain the highest possible standards, and pursue ongoing learning in order to bring a laser like focus of energies to task accomplishment. These people take pride in their work and have a desire for accuracy as they take time to check over their work. Craftsmanship includes exactness, precision, accuracy, correctness, faithfulness, and fidelity. For some people, craftsmanship requires continuous reworking. Mario Cuomo, a great speechwriter and politician, once said that his speeches were never done—it was only a deadline that made him stop working on them!"
Habits of Mind,questioning and positing problems,"One of the distinguishing characteristics between humans and other forms of life is our inclination, and ability to FIND problems to solve. Effective problem solvers know how to ask questions to fill in the gaps between what they know and what they don't know. Effective questioners are inclined to ask a range of questions. For example: requests for data to support others' conclusions and assumptions—such questions as, ""What evidence do you have.....?"" ""How do you know that's true?"" ""How reliable is this data source?"" They pose questions about alternative points of view: ""From whose viewpoint are we seeing, reading of hearing?"" ""From what angle, what perspective are we viewing this situation?"" Students pose questions, which make causal connections and relationships: ""How are these people (events) (situations) related to each other?"" ""What produced this connection?"" They pose hypothetical problems characterized by ""iffy""-type questions: ""What do you think would happen IF.....?"" ""IF that is true, then what might happen if....?"""
Habits of Mind,applying past knowledge to new situations,"Intelligent human beings learn from experience. When confronted with a new and perplexing problem they will often draw forth experience from their past. They can often be heard to say, ""This reminds me of...."" or ""This is just like the time when I..."" They explain what they are doing now in terms of analogies with or references to previous experiences. They call upon their store of knowledge and experience as sources of data to support, theories to explain, or processes to solve each new challenge. Furthermore, they are able to abstract meaning from one experience, carry it forth, and apply it in a new and novel situation. Too often students begin each new task as if it were being approached for the very first time. Teachers are often dismayed when they invite students to recall how they solved a similar problem previously and students don't remember."
Habits of Mind,thinking and communicating with clarity and precision,"Language refinement plays a critical role in enhancing a person’s cognitive maps, and their ability to think critically which is the knowledge base for efficacious action. Enriching the complexity and specificity of language simultaneously produces effective thinking. Language and thinking are closely entwined. Like either side of a coin, they are inseparable. When you hear fuzzy language, it is a reflection of fuzzy thinking. Intelligent people strive to communicate accurately in both written and oral form taking care to use precise language, defining terms, using correct names and universal labels and analogies. They strive to avoid overgeneralizations, deletions and distortions. Instead they support their statements with explanations, comparisons, quantification, and evidence."
Habits of Mind,gathering data through all senses,"Intelligent people know that all information gets into the brain through the sensory pathways: gustatory, olfactory, tactile, kinesthetic, auditory, visual, Most linguistic, cultural, and physical learning is derived from the environment by observing or taking in through the senses. To know a wine it must be drunk; to know a role it must be acted; to know a game it must be played; to know a dance it must be moved; to know a goal it must be envisioned. Those whose sensory pathways are open, alert, and acute absorb more information from the environment than those whose pathways are withered, immune, and oblivious to sensory stimuli."
Habits of Mind,"creating, imagining, and innovating","All human beings have the capacity to generate novel, original, clever or ingenious products, solutions, and techniques—if that capacity is developed. Creative human beings try to conceive problem solutions differently, examining alternative possibilities from many angles. They tend to project themselves into different roles using analogies, starting with a vision and working backward, imagining they are the objects being considered. Creative people take risks and frequently push the boundaries of their perceived limits (Perkins 1985). They are intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated, working on the task because of the aesthetic challenge rather than the material rewards. Creative people are open to criticism. They hold up their products for others to judge and seek feedback in an ever-increasing effort to refine their technique. They are uneasy with the status quo. They constantly strive for greater fluency, elaboration, novelty, parsimony, simplicity, craftsmanship, perfection, beauty, harmony, and balance."
Habits of Mind,responding with wonderment and awe,"Describing the 200 best and brightest of the All USA College Academic Team identified by USA Today, Tracey Wong Briggs (1999) states, “They are creative thinkers who have a passion for what they do.” Efficacious people have not only an ""I CAN"" attitude, but also an ""I ENJOY"" feeling. They seek problems to solve for themselves and to submit to others. They delight in making up problems to solve on their own and request enigmas from others. They enjoy figuring things out by themselves, and continue to learn throughout their lifetimes. We want our students, however to be curious; to commune with the world around them; to reflect on the changing formations of a cloud; feel charmed by the opening of a bud; sense the logical simplicity of mathematical order. Students can find beauty in a sunset, intrigue in the geometric of a spider web, and exhilaration at the iridescence of a hummingbird's wings. They see the congruity and intricacies in the derivation of a mathematical formula, recognize the orderliness and adroitness of a chemical change, and commune with the serenity of a distant constellation. We want them feel compelled, enthusiastic and passionate about learning, inquiring and mastering."
Habits of Mind,taking responsible risks,"Flexible people seem to have an almost uncontrollable urge to go beyond established limits. They are uneasy about comfort; they ""live on the edge of their competence"". They seem compelled to place themselves in situations where they do not know what the outcome will be. They accept confusion, uncertainty, and the higher risks of failure as part of the normal process and they learn to view setbacks as interesting, challenging and growth producing. However, they are not behaving impulsively. Their risks are educated. They draw on past knowledge, are thoughtful about consequences and have a well-trained sense of what is appropriate. They know that all risks are not worth taking! Risk taking can be considered in two categories: those who see it as a venture and those who see it as adventure. The venture part of risk taking might be described by the venture capitalist. When a person is approached to take the risk of investing in a new business, she will look at the markets, see how well organized the ideas are, and study the economic projections. If she finally decides to take the risk, it is a well considered one.The adventure part of risk taking might be described by the experiences from project adventure. In this situation, there is a spontaneity, a willingness to take a chance in the moment. Once again, a person will only take the chance if they know that there is either past history that suggests that what they are doing is not going to be life threatening or if they believe that there is enough support in the group to protect them from harm. Ultimately, the learning from such high-risk experiences is that people are far more able to take actions than they previously believed. It is only through repeated experiences that risk taking becomes educated. It often is a cross between intuition, drawing on past knowledge and a sense of meeting new challenges. Bobby Jindal, executive Director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare states, “The only way to succeed is to be brave enough to risk failure. “ (Briggs, 1999 p 2A) When someone holds back from taking risks, he is confronted constantly with missed opportunities. Some students seem reluctant to take risks. Some students hold back games, new learning, and new friendships because their fear of failure is far greater than their experience of venture or adventure. They are reinforced by the mental voice that says, “ if you don’t try it, you won’t be wrong” or “if you try it and you are wrong, you will look stupid”. The other voice that might say, “if you don’t try it, you will never know” is trapped in fear and mistrust. They are more interested in knowing whether their answer is correct or not, rather than being challenged by the process of finding the answer. They are unable to sustain a process of problem solving and finding the answer over time, and therefore avoid ambiguous situations. They have a need for certainty rather than an inclination for doubt. We hope that students will learn how to take intellectual as well as physical risks. Students who are capable of being different, going against the grain of the common, thinking of new ideas and testing them with peers as well as teachers, are more likely to be successful in this age of innovation and uncertainty."
Habits of Mind,finding humor,"Another unique attribute of human beings is our sense of humor. Laughter transcends all human beings. Its’ positive effects on psychological functions include a drop in the pulse rate, the secretion of endorphins, an increased oxygen in the blood. It has been found to liberate creativity and provoke such higher level thinking skills as anticipation, finding novel relationships, visual imagery, and making analogies. People who engage in the mystery of humor have the ability to perceive situations from an original and often interesting vantagepoint. They tend to initiate humor more often, to place greater value on having a sense of humor, to appreciate and understand others' humor and to be verbally playful when interacting with others. Having a whimsical frame of mind, they thrive on finding incongruity and perceiving absurdities, ironies and satire; finding discontinuities and being able to laugh at situations and themselves. Some students find humor in all the ""wrong places""--human differences, ineptitude, injurious behavior, vulgarity, violence and profanity. They laugh at others yet are unable to laugh at themselves. We want our student to acquire the characteristic of creative problem solvers, they can distinguish between situations of human frailty and fallibility which are in need of compassion and those which are truly funny. (Dyer, 1997)."
Habits of Mind,thinking interdependently,"Human beings are social beings. We congregate in groups, find it therapeutic to be listened to, draw energy from one another, and seek reciprocity. In groups we contribute our time and energy to tasks that we would quickly tire of when working alone. In fact, we have learned that one of the cruelest forms of punishment that can be inflicted on an individual is solitary confinement. Cooperative humans realize that all of us together are more powerful, intellectually and/or physically, than any one individual. Probably the foremost disposition in the post industrial society is the heightened ability to think in concert with others; to find ourselves increasingly more interdependent and sensitive to the needs of others. Problem solving has become so complex that no one person can go it alone. No one has access to all the data needed to make critical decisions; no one person can consider as many alternatives as several people can. Some students may not have learned to work in groups; they have underdeveloped social skills. They feel isolated, they prefer their solitude. ""Leave me alone--I'll do it by my self"". "" They just don't like me"". ""I want to be alone."" Some students seem unable to contribute to group work either by being a ""job hog"" or conversely, letting others do all the work. Working in groups requires the ability to justify ideas and to test the feasibility of solution strategies on others. It also requires the development of a willingness and openness to accept the feedback from a critical friend. Through this interaction the group and the individual continue to grow. Listening, consensus seeking, giving up an idea to work with someone else's, empathy, compassion, group leadership, knowing how to support group efforts, altruism--all are behaviors indicative of cooperative human beings."
Habits of Mind,learning continuously,"Intelligent people are in a continuous learning mode. Their confidence, in combination with their inquisitiveness, allows them to constantly search for new and better ways. People with this Habit of Mind are always striving for improvement, always growing, always learning, always modifying and improving themselves. They seize problems, situations, tensions, conflicts and circumstances as valuable opportunities to learn. A great mystery about humans is that we confront learning opportunities with fear rather than mystery and wonder. We seem to feel better when we know rather than when we learn. We defend our biases, beliefs, and storehouses of knowledge rather than inviting the unknown, the creative and the inspirational. Being certain and closed gives us comfort while being doubtful and open gives us fear. From an early age, employing a curriculum of fragmentation, competition and reactiveness, students are trained to believe that deep learning means figuring out the truth rather than developing capabilities for effective and thoughtful action. They have been taught to value certainty rather than doubt, to give answers rather than to inquire, to know which choice is correct rather than to explore alternatives. Our wish is for creative students and people who are eager to learn. That includes the humility of knowing that we don't know, which is the highest form of thinking we will ever learn. Paradoxically, unless you start off with humility you will never get anywhere, so as the first step you have to have already what will eventually be the crowning glory of all learning: the humility to know--and admit--that you don't know and not be afraid to find out."

Kenya BECF Core Competencies for Basic Education,critical thinking and problem solving,"An important outcome of quality education is teaching learners how to think critically. The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way. When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions. Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information."

MELQO MODEL Framework,working memory,"Working memory is defined as the ability to store and mentally manipulate memory contents (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974; Davidson et al., 2006). Working memory is positively related to general intellectual functioning, mathematics and reading comprehension (Monette et al., 2011; Passolunghi et al., 2007; Swanson and Jerman, 2007; Lesaux et al., 2007). Issues with working memory are associated with difficulty following multistep directions, forgetfulness and inattention (Bignell and Cain, 2007; Engle et al., 1991; Gathercole et al., 2006). Verbal working memory is a weak but significant predictor of attentional ability in everyday activities, such as remembering long sentences and phone numbers (Groth-Marnat and Baker, 2003). Working memory is similarly important for learning, and may be closely related to inhibitory control. In young children (2 to 6 years old), measures of working memory and inhibitory control are strongly related to one another and can be assessed using the same tasks (Wiebe et al., 2008)."
MELQO MODEL Framework,inhibitory control,"Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress the processing of irrelevant yet dominant stimuli or responses (Nigg, 2000). Inhibitory control, along with flexible switching, has been identified as one of the first executive function skills to emerge, developing quickly during the pre-school years (Diamond and Doar, 1989; Diamond et al., 2002). Inhibitory control skills help children suppress inappropriate behaviours and thoughts that may distract them from instruction (Alexander et al., 1993; Blair, 2002; Sa?ez et al. 2012). Further, these skills are essential for cognition, educational attainment and social functioning (Blair, 2002; Espy et al., 2004). Measured prior to kindergarten, inhibitory control predicts mathematics skills in kindergarten; when measured in kindergarten, it predicts mathematics and early literacy skills in primary school (Blair and Razza, 2007)."
MELQO MODEL Framework,self-regulation,"Self-regulation refers to the ability to control emotions and social behaviour in the interest of engagement and participation in both social interactions and independent work. It encompasses the regulation of one’s own emotions both in social contexts and non-social contexts (such as delayed gratification). This construct is also strongly related to executive function, specifically inhibitory control (Liew, 2012)."
MELQO MODEL Framework,social cognition,"Social cognition captures children’s abilities to think about and comprehend social relationships with others, recognize the feelings of others, and, if required, take actions that are meant to make others feel better. Social cognition encompasses empathy – children’s abilities to read others’ emotions and respond appropriately – as well as prosocial behaviour that includes helping others who may be in distress. Understanding the feelings of oneself and others includes the ability to (1) comprehend basic emotions (e.g. happiness, sadness and anger) and how these emotions are expressed, as well as their antecedents, causes and consequences; (2) recognize that emotions are complex (e.g. two individuals can feel two different emotions in response to the same event); and (3) distinguish rules for how to display basic and more complex emotions (e.g. shame or guilt). Accurate interpretation of the feelings of others provides important information about social situations and what constitutes appropriate responses."
MELQO MODEL Framework,social competence,"Social competence, or how well children develop and maintain relationships with peers and adults, is a construct that includes the ability to coexist and interact with others in a competent manner – essentially getting along with other children and adults, and being part of a social group. Social competence is an important developmental skill that children start learning from the moment they are born and which forms the foundation for a social human being."
MELQO MODEL Framework,emotional well-being,"Emotional well-being refers to aspects of optimal mental health that, if not evident in a child at this early stage, could predict more serious mental health problems, such as anxiety – a potential sign of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); sadness, a potential precursor of depression; or the inability to control aggressive impulses – a precursor of oppositional and conduct disorders."
MESH,self-management,"Self-management, also referred to as “self-control” or “self-regulation,” is the ability to regulate one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations. This includes managing stress, delaying gratification, motivating oneself, and setting and working toward personal and academic goals. Students with strong self-management skills arrive to class prepared, pay attention, follow directions, allow others to speak without interruption, and work independently with focus."
MESH,self-efficacy,"Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s ability to succeed in achieving an outcome or reaching a goal. Self-efficacy is related to whether a student believes that s/he has sufficient control over his/her environment in order to succeed. High self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and environment and allows students to become effective advocates for themselves."
MESH,growth mindset,"Growth mindset is the belief that one’s abilities can grow with effort. Students with a growth mindset believe that they can develop their skills through effort, practice, and perseverance. These students embrace challenges, see mistakes as opportunities to learn, and persist in the face of setbacks. By contrast, students with a fixed mindset believe that their own intelligence and talent are innate traits that don’t change. These students typically worry about not looking smart, get upset by mistakes, and give up sooner on tough tasks."
MESH,social awareness,"Social Awareness is the ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures, to understand social and ethical norms for behavior, and to recognize family, school, and community resources and supports."

Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning,initiative and curiosity,"A desire to explore a range of topics, eagerly engage in activities, think and play creatively, and learn independently. Show an interest in learning. Learning begins with curiosity as children show an interest in learning and talking about a range of topics, ideas, and tasks (i.e., ask questions and seek new information). Show self-confidence in approaching new challenges. Children are open to learning more things when they have confidence in their abilities and are empowered to take on new challenges and experiences while developing new skills. Think and play imaginatively. Children learn through play. Their imagination paves the way for flexible thinking as they think beyond their immediate reality while playing alone or with others (e.g., fly like a butterfly). Think creatively and symbolically. Problem solving requires creative thinking and can also require the use of symbols to represent things beyond the here and now. Children learn these skills as they explore divergent uses of an object (e.g., use a table as a “tent”) and use one thing to represent another in play (e.g., line up chairs to be a “bus”)."
Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning,executive functioning,"Use their working memory. Working memory, or the ability to hold information in mind and “work with it,” is a skill that supports learning in all content areas. Children learn to remember and follow a routine, rules, or directions using relevant information (e.g., remember a few items your family needs at the grocery store as you shop). Maintain focused attention. Children learn to resist distractions and instead use self-control to maintain focused attention. Persist at tasks. Children show self-control by stopping impulsive actions and reactions, and they learn to persist at tasks, sometimes delaying gratification or resisting distractions to continue the task at hand through frustration or challenges (e.g., getting dressed in the morning). If needed, they may break the task into smaller, more manageable components. Think flexibly. Children learn to think flexibly about a problem or situation by switching rules, doing the opposite, thinking about someone else’s perspective, applying different strategies or transitioning from one activity to another. Plan ahead. Children learn to anticipate and consider future needs in preparing for activities. They set goals and then develop and follow through on plans."
Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning,reasoning and problem solving,"Make connections. Children learn to process information, connect related information and prior knowledge, and then complete a task or solve a problem (e.g., our shoes are dirty so we need to wipe them on the mat before going indoors). Recognize cause and effect relationships. Children learn to recognize when one thing makes another thing happen (e.g., poking a bubble will make it pop). Compare, contrast, and sort. Children learn more about things by observing how certain characteristics are similar or different (e.g., color, shape, size, texture, or sound), and they classify, match, and sort objects based on those characteristics (e.g., putting all the blue objects into one group). Consider and choose from multiple solutions or options. Children learn to investigate multiple solutions or options to solve a problem. They think critically about each one and evaluate it, then choose the most appropriate or effective solution. Evaluate their choice. Children learn to reflect on the solution or decision they made and decide whether or not it was successful. If it was not the best choice, they may go back and try another option."
Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning,emotional development and self-regulation,"Identify, name, and express their own emotions.

They come to understand that their feelings can change over time or in different situations and that they can have more than one feeling at the same time. Regulate their emotions. Children learn to cope with and manage strong feelings appropriately. They become aware of clues inside their bodies to tell the difference between comfortable and uncomfortable feelings. They learn to use calming down strategies such as belly breathing to work through uncomfortable feelings in stressful or emotional situations. Regulate their behavior.

Sesame Workshop Global Framework for Learning,social relationships,"Identify and name the feelings of others. Children learn that others may have feelings that are different from their own. They learn to identify the feelings of others by using clues such as facial expressions and body language. Recognize and care about the needs and feelings of others. Children begin to not only identify the feelings of others but also care about them. They may show empathy by expressing support (e.g., drawing a picture to cheer up a friend) or by helping (e.g., helping parents with tasks). Understand what a friend is. Children learn that a friend is someone who cares about them and whom they care about. They learn that a friend can look different and have different likes, wants, and needs than their own. Develop and maintain friendships.

They learn to respect the families of others, even when those families do not look or behave like their own. Families can vary by number of people, gender, roles, responsibilities, appearances, etc. Understand that different families live in different types of homes. Children learn that not all families live in homes like their own. Families can live in different places (urban, rural, etc.) and in different types of buildings (apartments/flats, houses, huts, etc.). Recognize that people in the community have different jobs.

Academic competence refers to school performance as shown, in part, by school grades, attendance, and test scores. Health competence involves using nutrition, exercise, and rest to keep oneself fit. Vocational competence involves work habits and explorations of career choices. Effective entrepreneurial skills may be one instance of vocational competence."

The PRACTICE Model,problem solving,"Problem Solving includes a range of discrete skills related to how individuals solve social problems. These skills are associated with specific facets of Conscientiousness. Much of the developmental and intervention work on social problem solving29 has emphasized an array of interconnected social information-processing skills30 individuals use when solving social problems (e.g., joining a group, resolving conflicts). These include attention to relevant cues, interpretation of cues and emotional reactions, goal setting and planning, access to behavioral responses from memory, evaluation of responses, decision making, behavioral enactment, and reflection (Crick & Dodge, 1994). Through socialization, direct instruction, and cultural influences, individuals develop relatively stable patterns of processing social (and non-social) information."
The PRACTICE Model,resilience,"Resilience has been defined as the ability to “bounce back” from adversity and thrive in the context of risk. Resilience refers to a pattern over time that is characterized by good eventual adaptation despite risk, stressors, or adversity. It also is defined by the ability to appropriately and realistically connect future goals and opportunities to one’s own abilities, and to adapt as needed to situational constraints. Resilient individuals cope well with stressors and do not get derailed by stressful events but persist and remain optimistic. Although there are individual differences in stress tolerance, resilience generally is a learned process that is facilitated through positive and supportive interactions with the environment. Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism are two of the Big Five traits that align with resilience, along with Grit, but it is the expression of these traits under difficult circumstances that is the defining feature of resilience."
The PRACTICE Model,achievement motivation,"Achievement Motivation includes an orientation towards success, mastery, and sense of purpose. It has been associated with the capacity and drive to pursue difficult tasks, to work toward desired goals, and a high degree of independence. Individuals who are high in achievement motivation will demonstrate both a desire to learn and a focus on mastery as well as (or even more than) performance goals. They view learning skills and intelligence as an effortful, incremental process that can be improved rather than an inherited trait that is relatively stable over time. In terms of personality traits, it is most closely aligned with Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience as well as the construct of Grit."
The PRACTICE Model,control,"Control (self-control) includes a range of self-regulatory skills that are evident when individuals are able to modulate and restrain their impulses or immediate reactions to stimuli. Control skills such as the ability to effectively focus attention, delay gratification, and inhibit impulsive responding are crucial for early academic achievement and have been linked to later adjustment, educational, and occupational success. They also are important for problem solving, as they allow individuals to “stop and think” before acting and respond in a controlled rather than automatic fashion. Control is related to the concept of delay discounting in that low levels of impulse control are linked to higher levels of discounting future rewards. Self-control is an important skill complement to Conscientiousness."
The PRACTICE Model,teamwork,"Teamwork refers broadly to a set of skills involved in getting along with others, understanding their feelings and points of view, communicating effectively, being helpful and agreeable, and not engaging in aggressive or bullying behaviors. In the social-emotional domain it has been defined more regularly as “relationship skills” that enable individuals to get along with and work effectively with others, including people from diverse cultures. Teamwork is highest among individuals who score high on personality traits of Extraversion and Agreeableness."
The PRACTICE Model,initiative,"Initiative can be conceptualized as the “active ingredient” that motivates individuals to operate as positive and successful actors in their own lives and in systems. Initiative hinges on personal agency31 and an internal locus of control, a belief that outcomes depend on one’s own actions rather than fate, chance, or others. It is linked to enterprise, taking charge, follow-through, determination, and leadership. It also facilitates effective engagement within organizational contexts. Although initiative and achievement motivation are related, they are distinct skills. Initiative relates to any type of “take charge” action such as picking up litter on the street, whereas achievement motivation is linked to a desire to succeed and is associated with setting long-term academic and career goals and following this pursuit in spite of obstacles that may occur along the way. Initiative correlates with mastery orientation to achievement and relates to the personality traits of Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness."
The PRACTICE Model,confidence,"Confidence includes beliefs and feelings about one’s abilities generally and in specific contexts. These beliefs have been referred to as self-efficacy or efficacy beliefs. Confidence also includes a realistic self-concept and positive feelings towards the self, often labeled self-esteem or self- confidence. In adolescence, it is an important component of identity development based on a positive sense of self and one’s direction and future in the world. Self-relevant constructs have been linked to low levels of Neuroticism."
The PRACTICE Model,ethics,"Ethics are skills that are characterized by strength of character, social responsibility, and principled behavior. There is considerable debate as to whether there are universal ethical values or whether ethics are relativistic or dependent on cultural norms. Still, in terms of labor market outcomes, it is possible to identify specific and more universally-accepted and relevant skills linked to honesty, following rules, following through on actions, fairness, and acting in a responsible manner. Clearly, society and employers require trustworthy citizens who follow cultural rules and norms. For example, GED-earning adults contribute less to the economy than high-school graduates, a pattern that is not attributable to differences in academic competence. Instead, GED earners may be less proficient in adhering to ethical, context-suitable behavior, because they missed opportunities to acquire these skills from school social interactions (Heckman & Rubinstein, 2001). Skills related to ethics such as following rules are associated with the personality trait of Conscientiousness."

UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,creativity,"Creativity, or being creative, is the ability to generate, articulate or apply inventive ideas, techniques and perspectives (Ferrari, 2009), often in a collaborative environment (Lucas and Hanson, 2016). In conjunction with critical thinking and problem-solving skills, to which it closely relates, creativity is a major component of purposeful thinking, i.e., a non-chaotic, orderly and organized thought process. Further, being creative is to a large extent connected to the learners’ cognitive abilities, including their analytic and evaluative skills (Sternberg, 2006). Ideational thought processes are fundamental to creative persons (Kozbelt et al., 2010), but creativity also intersects with social and personal management skills. Therefore, creativity, while also related to the arts, is a pre-condition to innovation and adaptive behaviours and solutions in all life settings, among them in learning settings and in the workplace (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2015). Creativity is linked to the effectiveness of other life skills, in particular critical thinking, problem identification (Sternberg, 2010), problem-solving (Torrance, 1977) and self-management."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,critical thinking,"Critical thinking, an instrumental life skill conducive to academic achievement, is a long-standing life skill, which allows ‘reflective thinking’: By thinking critically, children, youth and all individuals who learn to assess situations and assumptions, ask questions and develop various ways of thinking. Therefore, critical thinking involves higher-order executive functioning: This is a ‘meta-skill’ through which one learns to think about thinking and develop purposeful thinking processes, such as being able to discern and evaluate whether an argument makes sense or not."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,problem-solving,"A problem-solver has the ability to “think through steps that lead from a given state of affairs to a desired goal” (Barbey and Baralou, 2009). Another essential aspect of purposeful thinking, problem-solving is a high-order thinking process inter-related with other important life skills, such as critical thinking, analytical thinking, decision-making and creativity. More specifically, being able to solve problems implies a process of planning, i.e., the formulation of a method to attain the desired goal. Problem-solving begins with recognizing that a problematic situation exists and establishing an understanding of the nature of the situation. It requires the solver to identify the specific problem(s) to be solved, plan and carry out a solution, and monitor and evaluate progress throughout the activity (OECD, 2015)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,cooperation,"Cooperation, i.e., for an individual being cooperative and acting cooperatively, is the act or process of working together to get something done or to achieve a common purpose that is mutually beneficial (Tyler 2011). It can involve teamwork and active collaboration, which is a form of cooperation and is often used as a synonym. Cooperation is central to many activities in the everyday world encountered by children, youth and all learners in school, at home, at work, in the community, and at national and regional levels. Because cooperation is useful for problem solving and forms the basis for healthy social relationships, it is a core life skill directly related to family, social and political conflict management and resolution in MENA."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,negotiation,"In its simplest form, negotiation can be defined as a process of communication between at least two parties aimed at reaching agreements on their “perceived divergent interests” (Pruitt, 1998). Therefore, while the core life skill ‘negotiation’ relates to a process, it translates into the ability of an individual to interactively and effectively partake in a negotiation process until its conclusion by and among others, respecting others while being assertive, being cooperative, using communication skills, showing leadership skills while being civil, saying no when one’s wellbeing is threatened, etc."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,decision-making,"Decision-making skills, or the ability to choose between two or more courses of action, relate to “one of the basic cognitive processes of human behaviour by which a preferred option, or a course of action, is chosen from among a set of alternatives based on certain criteria” (Wang, 2007). Decision-making is used by all individuals on a daily basis, as they are regularly faced with situations in which they have to make a judgement about how best to proceed, and also when it is most appropriate to do so. Notably, decision-making has consequences on all individuals’ wellbeing through the effects of the choices they make (WHO, 1997)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,self-management,"A core life skill, highlighted first in its Individual Dimension towards personal empowerment, self-management, or both self-managing and being self-managed, is the individual ability to regulate and monitor one’s behaviours, emotions, feelings and impulses. Thus, it constitutes a broad category of related skills that includes self-control, self-efficacy and selfawareness, as well as positive attitude, reliability, self-presentation and is strongly linked with the core life skill of resilience. These have wide applicability in all domains of life, from personal relationships at home to peer-relationships at school, and have been identified as common employability skills applicable to a range of jobs (Blades et al., 2012)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,resilience,"Consensus on the meaning of the term resilience has yet to emerge (UNESCO, 2015b), and that may be largely due to its recent broadened use, referring to contexts as varied in their intensity as coping with stress at work to the grave psychosocial impact of child abuse, extremism, violent conflict and displacement, in particular on children and youth. Because it is highly contextualized, ‘being resilient’ will have different levels of depth for the individual developing and/or displaying that core life skill, especially in MENA. In all cases, however, the life skill of resilience shall be understood, in general terms, as the constructive, personal ability to navigate changing circumstances successfully (American Psychological Association, 2010), thus beyond the restrictive understanding, according to which resilience is constrained to the capacity to survive, accept or resign oneself to an unacceptable situation."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,communication,"Communication, or being able to communicate, involves the sharing of meaning through the exchange of information and common understanding (Keyton, 2011; Lunenberg, 2010; Castells, 2009). It takes place in the context of social relationships (Schiller, 2007; Castells, 2009) between two or more individuals and is considered an interpersonal skill. While communication enables human interaction and participation in society, the prevalence of new technologies and social media, particularly among youth in MENA, indicates a strong human drive for social communication (Kuhl, 2011; Dennis et al., 2016)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,respect for diversity,"In the context of the LSCE Initiative, ‘respect for diversity’ – or being respectful of diversity – is conceptualized as a key interpersonal life skill. It is based on the understanding developed by moral philosophers that acknowledges that human beings are equal participants in a common ethical world by virtue of their human status (Janoff-Bulmann et al., 2008). In this composite life skill, the concept of diversity means understanding that each individual is unique and recognizing each other’s individual differences. These can be defined along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other characteristics. Respect for diversity thus implies more than just tolerance, which is related to accepting differences passively, it means acknowledging and promoting the equal worth of peoples, without condescension (UNICEF, 2007b)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,empathy,"Empathy, or being empathetic, is “the ability to comprehend another’s feelings and to re-experience them oneself” (Salovey and Mayer, 1990), while never being judgemental. A key construct in social and developmental psychology as well as in cognitive and social neuroscience, the ability to empathize is important for promoting positive behaviours toward others, and facilitating social interactions and relationships. Empathy is involved in the internalization of rules that can play a part in protecting others, and, it may be the mechanism that motivates the desire to help others, even at a cost to oneself. In addition, empathy plays an important role in becoming a socially competent person with meaningful social relationships (McDonald and Messinger, 2012). Consequently, empathy motivates altruistic behaviour and has the potential to enhance the process by which rights are realized, which is as important as an outcome (Jönsson and Hall, 2003)."
UNICEF MENA Life Skills and Citizenship Education - Conceptual and Programmatic Framework,participation,"In its most basic sense, participation or being participative, can be defined as partaking in, and influencing, processes, decisions and activities (adapted from UNICEF, 2001). Therefore, both a contextualized process as well as a core life skill, participation is an action of empowerment in relation to the individual and the community. Consequently, being participative, which is interlinked with to the core life skill of creativity, is the contrary to remaining passive at school, at work, and, above all, in society. More than being engaged, learners and individuals who are participative, especially in MENA, actively contribute to a democratic society, by the people, thus exercising their human rights."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,self-control,"Self-controlrefers to one’s ability to control and regulate oneself. This includes one’s ability to control impulses, delay gratification, direct and focus attention, and regulate and modulate emotions and behaviors. Self-control is highly supported by the literature as related to workforce outcomes. In the violence prevention and psychology literature, a distinction between two important aspects of self-control is emphasized: self-control of behavior, and self-control of emotion. Self-control is key for managing impulsivity that is linked with aggression and gang membership. Of all of the youth soft skills examined, self-control had the most support of all in the violence prevention literature across outcomes and types of literature. The association between both types of self-control and youth violence prevention was also highly supported in the expert consultations."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,positive self-concept,"Positive self-conceptrefers to “a realistic awareness of oneself and one’s abilities that reflects an understanding of his/her strengths and potential (and hence, is, positive)” (Lippman et al., 2015). In addition to being an important intrapersonal skill for workforce success, positive self-concept is supported by empirical evidence and experts in the field as an important skill for preventing different forms of youth violence. Positive self-concept enables youth to walk away from a fight, or successfully navigate challengingtasks and situations at work. Experts highlight that the effects of positive self-concept on violence prevention outcomes may operate through different mechanisms and may differ depending on the context."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,higher order thinking skills,"Higher order thinkingskills include problem solving, criticalthinking, and decision making. They refer to the “ability to identify an issue and take in information from multiple sources to evaluate options in order to reach a reasonable conclusion” (Lippman et al., 2015). Higher order thinkingis sought by employers and is critical for workforce success. Higher order thinking skills also garnered considerable support from the literature as important skills in the prevention of youth violence. Important higher order thinking skills for violence prevention often include accurately interpreting others’ behaviors and using non-aggressive problem solving strategies. When higher order thinking skills are included in studies, the findings are generally positive and consistent. However, research on discrete higher order thinking skills is not as prevalent as the research on self-control, social skills, and empathy."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,social skills,"Social skillsare related to getting along with others. Social skills allow youth to interact productively in social contexts and to respond to emotions or conflict in socially appropriate, non-aggressive ways. Social skills can be generally conceptualized as the ability to interact positively and pro-socially with others. Social skills predict workforce outcomes and are highly sought by employers. In the violence prevention literature, social skills are operationalized as including “interpersonal skills,” the ability to take prosocial approaches to conflicts, engaging positively with others, and the positive attribution of others’ intentions. The evidence for a link between youth’ssocial skills and violence prevention outcomesin the literature is strong and appears consistently across all categories of outcomes and contexts. Researchersand practitioners also endorsed social skills as essential for youth violence prevention."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,communication,"Communicationrefers to one’s ability to effectively express and understand knowledge and ideas. Modes of communication include listening, verbal, non-verbal, and written communication. Communication skills are related to workforce outcomes and are the most frequently sought skill among employers. Within the SRH literature, a distinction between twoaspects of communication is evident: communication with parents and communication with partners. Between partners, communication related to sexual behavior often takes the form of negotiating sexual initiation and use of contraception, including condoms. There isstrongevidence that communication skills are positively related to SRH outcomes."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,empathy,"Empathyrefers to “the affective and cognitive ability to feel and understand what someoneelse is feeling” (Lippman et al., 2014a).Some violence prevention literature distinguishes types of empathy, with “cognitive empathy” referring to one’s ability to cognitively take another’s perspective and identify their state of mind, while “affective empathy” refers to the ability to share in another’s emotional state (Caravita, di Blasio, andSalmivalli, 2008). Across the literature reviewed, there is more evidence linking affective empathy with violence prevention outcomes in youth than cognitive empathy."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,goal orientation,"Goal orientationis defined as the motivation and ability to make viable plans and take action toward desired goals (Lippman et al., 2014a). Goal orientation was conceptualized in the workforce and SRH literature as educational and career aspirations, expectations about one’s ability to achieve specific accomplishments in the future, goal setting and planning skills. Goal orientation is closely tied with positive self-concept, since it relates to individuals’ beliefs about their abilities to accomplish specific goals. Goal-orientation was supported by the literature as related to three of the SRH outcomes studied for youth and was endorsed by some experts."
USAID YouthPower Action Key Soft Skills for Cross-Sectoral Youth Outcomes,responsibility,"Responsibility is defined as “1) one’s ability to understand their role (in a particular context, i.e., home, school, workplace, relationship) and reliably accomplish tasks associated with this role ... and 2) one’s belief that their choices and actions can influence the events in their life and lead to positive outcomes” (Lippman et al., 2015, “Appendices,” p. 104). The violence prevention and SRH literatures emphasize the latter aspect."

Young Adult Success,values,"Enduring, often culturally defined beliefs about what is good or bad, and what is important in life. Values include both the moral code of conduct one uses in daily activities (e.g., being kind, being truthful) and long-term “outcomes” of importance (e.g., getting an education, having a family, contributing to the community) that may not necessarily have a right or wrong valence. Values develop through a process of exploration and experimentation, where young people make sense of their experiences and refine what they believe in. Values are a key developmental task during middle adolescence and young adulthood"
