FACETS,Abstract Thinking,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,understanding and applying abstract concepts such as analogies and metaphors,"Abstraction is the ability to think flexibly about ideas rather than just concrete circumstances, including words and events. The ability to engage in abstract thinking is essential to many forms of human expression, including mathematics, science, literature, play, humor etc. Abstract thinking includes skills such as the ability to think about numbers without having something to count, and to play “make-believe” or to tell an imaginary story (e.g., fairy tales). Without abstract thinking, it is difficult to expand thoughts and ideas beyond the concrete objects, limiting creative problem-solving."
FACETS,Academic Motivation,Academic Skills and School Functioning,applying skills and abilities to achieve academic goals,"Academic motivation is an individual’s general commitment to scholarly/learning activities. It includes not only the determination to acquire knowledge and skills in school, but also the development of the tools necessary to successfully perform in the academic context. While often reduced to “grades,” this method fails to capture the commitment necessary to establish and maintain appropriate subject level knowledge and skills (e.g., mathematics, science, language, history, etc.), as well as the willingness to flexibly and adaptively use general and specific resources (e.g., mentors, libraries, collaboration, etc.) needed to succeed."

The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way. When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions. Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information.",

FACETS,Distorted Perceptions of Reality,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,inappropriate or inaccurate interpretation of events experiences and thoughts,"Perception of reality, or “reality testing,” is the ability to consistently discern the difference between facts and fantasy or other imagined thought content and perceptions. While each of us may have a vivid imagination and fantasies, except under extraordinary circumstances, we can readily distinguish between reality and that which we imagine. The extraordinary circumstances under which clearly recognizing reality may be impaired, include: extreme stress, during intense grief, when very defensive, and when engaged in intense play or similar activity. In these latter cases, the difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy/imagination is usually short-lived and quite specific to the circumstances (e.g., seeing visions of the presence of a recently deceased person). Specific difficulties associated with problems in reality perception include: hallucination (i.e., hearing, seeing, feeling or other sensation in the absence or an actual stimulus), delusion (i.e., a false belief), illusion (i.e., gross misperception of an actual stimulus), etc."
FACETS,Eating,General Well-Being,maintaining dietary intake and nutrition,"Eating is a complex behavior that has both nutritional and social components. The nutritional component is the appropriate consumption of both calories (for energy) and the elements of the diet (protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, etc.) necessary for maintaining healthy function. There are two main social components of eating: the social interactions associated with the preparation and consumption of food, and the cultural elements associated with menus, dining schedules, and food consumption (e.g., Kosher, Hallal, vegan/vegetarian, etc.) Food preparation and dining are often social experiences that reflect culture and other expectations for cooperation and sharing of both food and conversation, as well as engagement in a variety of behaviors directly associated with eating, such as use of specific utensils (chopsticks, fork, spoon, hands, etc.), cleanliness, order, and the nature of physical presence (e.g., sitting in a chair, standing, walking, sitting cross-legged on the floor, use of a particular hand, etc.) Appropriate participation in all elements of eating are important for health and happiness."

Frameworks,resilience,The PRACTICE Model,"Resilience has been defined as the ability to “bounce back” from adversity and thrive in the context of risk. Resilience refers to a pattern over time that is characterized by good eventual adaptation despite risk, stressors, or adversity. It also is defined by the ability to appropriately and realistically connect future goals and opportunities to one’s own abilities, and to adapt as needed to situational constraints. Resilient individuals cope well with stressors and do not get derailed by stressful events but persist and remain optimistic. Although there are individual differences in stress tolerance, resilience generally is a learned process that is facilitated through positive and supportive interactions with the environment. Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism are two of the Big Five traits that align with resilience, along with Grit, but it is the expression of these traits under difficult circumstances that is the defining feature of resilience.",

Difficulty may be seen in frequent lost items, missing materials, damaged supplies, or needing repeated reminders to bring or return needed items."
FACETS,Responsibility for Self & Others,Interacting with Others,accepting responsibility for actions taken by self or others,"Responsibility is the willingness and ability to appropriately manage or control self, situations and/or the actions of other individuals. The ability to assume responsibility begins with managing one’s own actions, emotions, and cognitions, then gradually expands to being more in control of interactions with others and broader elements of the environment. When faced with new tasks or uncertainty, there may be cautionary over-control followed by fading to a balance between self-control and sharing control with others."
FACETS,Risk Taking,Behavior Control and Regulation,taking chances to achieve goals when faced with possible failure embarrassment or harm,"Risk taking is the ability to overcome the possibility of failure, embarrassment, or harm in order to achieve a specific goal or to acquire a particular want or need.

Sensations typically includes the five senses (e.g., touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing), however, somatic perceptions (e.g., pain, heart rate, respiratory rate, kinesthetics, etc.) are often sensed quite acutely, and can modulate emotions, cognitions, and behavior. Precision in the identification of sensory inputs and the reaction to them is essential for safe interactions with the environment as well as appropriate social function."
FACETS,Sexual/Gender Identity and Behavior,Sense of Self,expressing age-appropriate sexual identity and behavior,"Sexual behavior includes behaviors that are related to an individual's particular individual “sexual identity.” While there are generally male and female biological differences amongst humans, there exists a broad spectrum of gender-related behaviors that are “assigned” or “learned,” based on cultural and social expectations in a community, not infrequently independent of “sex assigned at birth.” Some behaviors appear to be “assigned,” and are often considered “conventional.” When there are variations that don’t meet social expectations, it can cause discomfort - for children, peers, and/or adults - and can lead to adverse outcomes like bullying, discrimination and social isolation. Examples of these are so-called “effeminate” males or “masculine” females. Most “unconventional” gender behaviors are not abnormal but simply represent the broad variation in expressions of identity."
FACETS,Sleep Disturbance,General Well-Being,evidence of inadequate duration or quality of sleep including drowsiness and persistent lack of energy,"While the precise function of sleep is unknown, sleep appears to be a physiological state in which the brain rests and resets some of its functions. While the brain is engaged in sleep, the remainder of the human body also gets a chance to rest and recover from the physical exertion of the previous day. Sleep may also play a restorative role for physiologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning and wellbeing. Sleep has discrete stages, one of which allows for dreaming. Typically, individuals sleep varying amounts of time, ranging from 4-10 hours, usually, but not necessarily occurring at night. Daytime napping may also be a healthy component of sleep. One goal for sleep is to gain adequate amounts of rest to support ongoing activities during the waking hours. Pre-bedtime and bedtime routines are commonly associated with sleep, and may include social activities (e.g., story telling, prayers, reading, etc.). Sleep difficulties include either inadequate or excessive amounts of sleep, as well as excessive and inappropriate daytime drowsiness."

FACETS,Social Communication,Interacting with Others,communication enabling social interactions,"Social functioning is the ability to share thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors. Social communication includes words and gestures in conjunction with an “invitation” to respond, as well as the willingness to receive and accept social responses. This leads to reciprocity, or “turn-taking,” the repeated exchanges of thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors that form the basis of conversation, discussion, collaborative work, and play."
FACETS,Social Cooperation,Interacting with Others,cooperating in social interactions including play,"Cooperation is working together with other individuals, or in groups, to achieve a common goal or objective. This requires effective communication for sharing of thoughts, ideas, and plans, as well as a willingness to be flexible and context sensitive when sharing behaviors and communications."
FACETS,Social Engagement,Interacting with Others,engaging in social behavior,"Social engagement is the combination of intent to form and maintain social interactions combined with the appropriate and flexible application of social speech, cues, gestures, and behaviors (e.g., smiling, visual regard, hand shaking/bowing, etc.).

FACETS,Speech Quality,Expressive Communication,speaking understandably,"Speech is the production of sounds that are most often formed into words which can be linked to form sentences, paragraphs, descriptions, requests, stories, and much more. Using variations in rate, tone, rhythm, volume, clarity, word/sound selection, coordination with non-verbal communication, and other elements of sound production enhance the understandability of the intended communication. Flexible and adaptable speech offers greater possibility that the intended message will be received and properly interpreted by the listener."
FACETS,Speech Quantity,Expressive Communication,speaking with an appropriate number of words for communication,"Language is the full spectrum of communicative behaviors. It includes words, gestures, body posture, facial expression, and a myriad of other behaviors that have communicative intent. This item refers ONLY to spoken language - speech. There is enormous variation in speech quantity that is partly dependent on context (“Is this a time to be quiet or a time to offer to speak up?”) and also depends on the capability of the individual to speak about specific content (“Does the individual know anything about the present topic?” “Are they lacking confidence with respect to that content?”) Or, does the individual have the physical ability to produce speech at all. Thus, the quantity of speech may typically vary depending on context and content, however, individuals with problems related to speech quantity have difficulty regulating the amount of speaking in appropriate response to the context or content."
FACETS,Stress Management,Emotional Expression,managing tension resulting from challenges or demands,"Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension that is the body’s reaction to an internal or external challenge or demand. The internal factors can be thoughts, ideas, emotions, or even cognitive and emotional challenges. External factors may include leisure, work, or social demands. The response to stress can be both cognitive-emotional, as well as physiologic. Stress responses are adaptive when they are developmentally and behaviorally appropriate to the intensity, complexity, and duration of the demand or challenge."
Frameworks,striving for accuracy and precision,Habits of Mind,"Embodied in the stamina, grace and elegance of a ballerina or a shoemaker, is the desire for craftsmanship, mastery, flawlessness and economy of energy to produce exceptional results. People who value accuracy, precision and craftsmanship take time to check over their products. They review the rules by which they are to abide; they review the models and visions they are to follow; and they review the criteria they are to employ and confirm that their finish product matches the criteria exactly. To be craftsmanlike means knowing that one can continually perfect one's craft by working to attain the highest possible standards, and pursue ongoing learning in order to bring a laser like focus of energies to task accomplishment. These people take pride in their work and have a desire for accuracy as they take time to check over their work. Craftsmanship includes exactness, precision, accuracy, correctness, faithfulness, and fidelity. For some people, craftsmanship requires continuous reworking. Mario Cuomo, a great speechwriter and politician, once said that his speeches were never done—it was only a deadline that made him stop working on them!",
FACETS,Substance Use,General Well-Being,using inappropriate substances including alcohol tobacco and cannabis,"Substance use is the consumption of chemicals that disrupt cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning. The most common substance use is alcohol and nicotine, but can also include a broad variety of substances, including the inappropriate use of prescribed medications. Persistent use of substances that leads to disruption in function is referred to as substance abuse. It is said that for some individuals, the recreational use of some substances may be acceptable, however, it is not clear who can safely use which substances. All evidence suggests that even the most benign of these medications and substances that are used inappropriately can have both short- and long-term disruptions in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning, even modest doses, and may also be associated with significant general health complications. Addiction is a subset of substance abuse that is characterized by habitual, often uncontrollable use of substances, and a “withdrawal syndrome” when the substances are discontinued."
FACETS,Task Completion,Organization & Planning,recognizing beginning structure and end of tasks,"It is typical to spontaneously take on tasks and willingly accept task assignments. Task completion is the ability to appreciate that all tasks have beginnings and ends, while also finding satisfaction in moving to and achieving a goal.

Multiple factors contribute to the enormous variation in thinking speed as individuals process information, including attention, intellectual ability, interests, familiarity, and memory, as well as environment and practice. It is important to manage thinking speed in order to allocate flexible amounts of time to appropriately address varying problems and challenges. Thinking faster is not always helpful as it may lead to errors, whereas thinking slowly may lead to missed opportunities. Finding successful balance in regulating thinking speed is essential for successful adaptation."
FACETS,Tics and Atypical Movements,Motor Skills,adapting social and other behaviors in response to tics or atypical movements,"Tics (repetitive motor behaviors), as well as disruptions in motor rhythm and coordination fluidity constitute atypical movements. Atypical movements may include fine or gross motor activity, involve very rapid to very slow movements, and have varying size of movements. Tics may involve facial muscles (e.g., twitching), trunk and limb muscle movements (e.g., head and shoulder shrugging), as well vocal tics (i.e., respiratory and laryngeal muscle movements yielding either sounds or words.) Atypical movements often make affected individuals feel sad, embarrassed, frustrated, and anxious; they often become victims of mockery, shaming, and bullying."
FACETS,Toileting Problems,General Well-Being,managing toileting behaviors and routines,"Managing toileting and hygiene is a basic social and behavioral skill that is essential for successful adaptive function. It includes self-management of excretions, as well as cleaning oneself. Intrinsic to managing toileting and hygiene, is a personal understanding of one’s own daily rhythms and the extent to which one can control them, in the context of other environmental events (e.g., school/work, leisure, sleep, meals etc.). Therefore successful toileting and hygiene includes proper scheduling and the use of socially-appropriate behaviors to complete toileting and hygiene tasks."
FACETS,Tolerance,Interacting with Others,responding appropriately to differences in cultures and belief systems,"Tolerance is the willingness and ability to thoughtfully and fairly judge values and belief systems.

It is important to anticipate pending transitions and plan for what comes next. The departure requires the timely gathering of objects necessary for the transition, so that the departure can take place in an orderly and timely fashion. Transitions routines often use appropriate social elements (e.g., “Good-bye,” “See you tomorrow,” “Thank you,” waving or hugs, etc.), as well as addressing of safety concerns (e.g., “hold my hand”, “put on your seat belt”, etc.)"
FACETS,Trauma History,General Well-Being,having directly or indirectly experienced traumatic events,"In the course of typical, daily life, there are events of varying intensity that cause emotional or physical pain or disturbance (e.g., injury or death of a loved one). While upsetting and possibly causing “trauma-related symptoms,” they are not likely to lead to a trauma diagnosis. These symptoms generally resolve quickly and without long-term impact. On occasion, depending on the individual and the nature of the events, symptoms may persist. And, even more rarely, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), may appear. Severe traumatic reactions are generally associated with events in which the individual’s health safety and/or life are in immediate jeopardy. Individuals are more likely to be affected the closer they are in time and space to traumatic events."
