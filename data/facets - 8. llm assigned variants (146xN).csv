"Abstract Thinking, symbolic representation","FACETS (Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction), Frameworks (K-3 SEL Standards (Connecticut))",understanding and applying abstract concepts such as analogies and metaphors///Full set of indicators in framework.,"Abstraction is the ability to think flexibly about ideas rather than just concrete circumstances, including words and events. The ability to engage in abstract thinking is essential to many forms of human expression, including mathematics, science, literature, play, humor etc. Abstract thinking includes skills such as the ability to think about numbers without having something to count, and to play “make-believe” or to tell an imaginary story (e.g., fairy tales). Without abstract thinking, it is difficult to expand thoughts and ideas beyond the concrete objects, limiting creative problem-solving.///"

It has been associated with the capacity and drive to pursue difficult tasks, to work toward desired goals, and a high degree of independence. Individuals who are high in achievement motivation will demonstrate both a desire to learn and a focus on mastery as well as (or even more than) performance goals. They view learning skills and intelligence as an effortful, incremental process that can be improved rather than an inherited trait that is relatively stable over time. In terms of personality traits, it is most closely aligned with Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience as well as the construct of Grit.///Student is cooperative and noticeably engaged.","Academic motivation is an individual’s general commitment to scholarly/learning activities. It includes not only the determination to acquire knowledge and skills in school, but also the development of the tools necessary to successfully perform in the academic context. While often reduced to “grades,” this method fails to capture the commitment necessary to establish and maintain appropriate subject level knowledge and skills (e.g., mathematics, science, language, history, etc.), as well as the willingness to flexibly and adaptively use general and specific resources (e.g., mentors, libraries, collaboration, etc.) needed to succeed.///The student's apparent internal desire to engage with academic content, complete schoolwork, and pursue educational goals.///A student's willingness to try their best, persist with challenging work, and put forth genuine effort on academic tasks///The student's internal motivation, effort, and persistence when engaging with academic material and learning challenges.///The student's drive to learn, willingness to put forth effort, and intrinsic interest in academic activities//////"

It can involve teamwork and active collaboration, which is a form of cooperation and is often used as a synonym. Cooperation is central to many activities in the everyday world encountered by children, youth and all learners in school, at home, at work, in the community, and at national and regional levels. Because cooperation is useful for problem solving and forms the basis for healthy social relationships, it is a core life skill directly related to family, social and political conflict management and resolution in MENA.///Working with others///Working well with others///expressing respect for others’ contributions and different styles assessing one’s own abilities and contributing to the group///Communication is the act of transferring information from one place to another, whether vocally, visually, or non-verbally.

In groups we contribute our time and energy to tasks that we would quickly tire of when working alone. In fact, we have learned that one of the cruelest forms of punishment that can be inflicted on an individual is solitary confinement. Cooperative humans realize that all of us together are more powerful, intellectually and/or physically, than any one individual. Probably the foremost disposition in the post industrial society is the heightened ability to think in concert with others; to find ourselves increasingly more interdependent and sensitive to the needs of others. Problem solving has become so complex that no one person can go it alone. No one has access to all the data needed to make critical decisions; no one person can consider as many alternatives as several people can. Some students may not have learned to work in groups; they have underdeveloped social skills. They feel isolated, they prefer their solitude. ""Leave me alone--I'll do it by my self"". "" They just don't like me"". ""I want to be alone."" Some students seem unable to contribute to group work either by being a ""job hog"" or conversely, letting others do all the work. Working in groups requires the ability to justify ideas and to test the feasibility of solution strategies on others. It also requires the development of a willingness and openness to accept the feedback from a critical friend. Through this interaction the group and the individual continue to grow.

The British Council (2015) identifies three types of thinking: reasoning, making judgements, and problem solving. It is possible for learners to reason in an uncritical way. When learners are empowered with critical thinking, they avoid being subjective, and use logic and evidence to arrive at conclusions. Critical thinking also facilitates exploring new ways of doing things and learner autonomy. Learners learn that for every issue there are multiple perspectives that they can explore, rather than a rigid recall and regurgitation of information.///Girls can identify 2-3 steps that can be taken to solve a problem creatively or resolve a conflict.

Another essential aspect of purposeful thinking, problem-solving is a high-order thinking process inter-related with other important life skills, such as critical thinking, analytical thinking, decision-making and creativity. More specifically, being able to solve problems implies a process of planning, i.e., the formulation of a method to attain the desired goal. Problem-solving begins with recognizing that a problematic situation exists and establishing an understanding of the nature of the situation. It requires the solver to identify the specific problem(s) to be solved, plan and carry out a solution, and monitor and evaluate progress throughout the activity (OECD, 2015).///generating solutions and trying different approaches when stuck///Critical thinking, an instrumental life skill conducive to academic achievement, is a long-standing life skill, which allows ‘reflective thinking’: By thinking critically, children, youth and all individuals who learn to assess situations and assumptions, ask questions and develop various ways of thinking.

Distorted Perceptions of Reality,FACETS (Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction),inappropriate or inaccurate interpretation of events experiences and thoughts,"Perception of reality, or “reality testing,” is the ability to consistently discern the difference between facts and fantasy or other imagined thought content and perceptions. While each of us may have a vivid imagination and fantasies, except under extraordinary circumstances, we can readily distinguish between reality and that which we imagine. The extraordinary circumstances under which clearly recognizing reality may be impaired, include: extreme stress, during intense grief, when very defensive, and when engaged in intense play or similar activity. In these latter cases, the difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy/imagination is usually short-lived and quite specific to the circumstances (e.g., seeing visions of the presence of a recently deceased person). Specific difficulties associated with problems in reality perception include: hallucination (i.e., hearing, seeing, feeling or other sensation in the absence or an actual stimulus), delusion (i.e., a false belief), illusion (i.e., gross misperception of an actual stimulus), etc."

They create and seek novel approaches and have a well-developed sense of humor. They envision a range of consequences. Flexible people can approach a problem from a new angle using a novel approach {deBono (1970) refers to this as lateral thinking.} They consider alternative points of view or deal with several sources of information simultaneously. Their minds are open to change based on additional information and data or reasoning, which contradicts their beliefs.

Thus, flexibility of mind is essential for working with social diversity, enabling an individual to recognize the wholeness and distinctness of other people's ways of experiencing and making meaning. Flexible thinkers are able to shift, at will, through multiple perceptual positions. One perceptual orientation is what Jean Piaget called, egocentrism--perceiving from our own point of view.

Initiative hinges on personal agency31 and an internal locus of control, a belief that outcomes depend on one’s own actions rather than fate, chance, or others. It is linked to enterprise, taking charge, follow-through, determination, and leadership. It also facilitates effective engagement within organizational contexts. Although initiative and achievement motivation are related, they are distinct skills. Initiative relates to any type of “take charge” action such as picking up litter on the street, whereas achievement motivation is linked to a desire to succeed and is associated with setting long-term academic and career goals and following this pursuit in spite of obstacles that may occur along the way.

Working memory is positively related to general intellectual functioning, mathematics and reading comprehension (Monette et al., 2011; Passolunghi et al., 2007; Swanson and Jerman, 2007; Lesaux et al., 2007). Issues with working memory are associated with difficulty following multistep directions, forgetfulness and inattention (Bignell and Cain, 2007; Engle et al., 1991; Gathercole et al., 2006). Verbal working memory is a weak but significant predictor of attentional ability in everyday activities, such as remembering long sentences and phone numbers (Groth-Marnat and Baker, 2003). Working memory is similarly important for learning, and may be closely related to inhibitory control. In young children (2 to 6 years old), measures of working memory and inhibitory control are strongly related to one another and can be assessed using the same tasks (Wiebe et al., 2008).///Child holds information in mind and manipulates it to perform tasks","Memory is a complex biological function that allows for the brain to store and recall factual information and related emotional and other factors that are linked to the facts. There are multiple forms of memory to account for different uses of the stored information. Short-term memory is for the management of information that is needed temporarily to complete a brief task. For intermediate level activities, information from short-term memory is transferred to working memory for more extended task completion. Long-term memory is information that may be used again and again and/or over extended periods of time. The durability of a particular memory depends a great deal on the importance of that which is being remembered, the linkages of that memory to other important factors (i.e., emotions, location, sensory associations, other memories, etc.), repetition of the memory over the course of time, and distractions or disruptions when the memory is being stored.//////"

They are uneasy about comfort; they ""live on the edge of their competence"". They seem compelled to place themselves in situations where they do not know what the outcome will be. They accept confusion, uncertainty, and the higher risks of failure as part of the normal process and they learn to view setbacks as interesting, challenging and growth producing. However, they are not behaving impulsively. Their risks are educated. They draw on past knowledge, are thoughtful about consequences and have a well-trained sense of what is appropriate. They know that all risks are not worth taking! Risk taking can be considered in two categories: those who see it as a venture and those who see it as adventure. The venture part of risk taking might be described by the venture capitalist. When a person is approached to take the risk of investing in a new business, she will look at the markets, see how well organized the ideas are, and study the economic projections. If she finally decides to take the risk, it is a well considered one.The adventure part of risk taking might be described by the experiences from project adventure. In this situation, there is a spontaneity, a willingness to take a chance in the moment. Once again, a person will only take the chance if they know that there is either past history that suggests that what they are doing is not going to be life threatening or if they believe that there is enough support in the group to protect them from harm. Ultimately, the learning from such high-risk experiences is that people are far more able to take actions than they previously believed. It is only through repeated experiences that risk taking becomes educated. It often is a cross between intuition, drawing on past knowledge and a sense of meeting new challenges. Bobby Jindal, executive Director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare states, “The only way to succeed is to be brave enough to risk failure. “ (Briggs, 1999 p 2A) When someone holds back from taking risks, he is confronted constantly with missed opportunities. Some students seem reluctant to take risks. Some students hold back games, new learning, and new friendships because their fear of failure is far greater than their experience of venture or adventure. They are reinforced by the mental voice that says, “ if you don’t try it, you won’t be wrong” or “if you try it and you are wrong, you will look stupid”. The other voice that might say, “if you don’t try it, you will never know” is trapped in fear and mistrust. They are more interested in knowing whether their answer is correct or not, rather than being challenged by the process of finding the answer. They are unable to sustain a process of problem solving and finding the answer over time, and therefore avoid ambiguous situations. They have a need for certainty rather than an inclination for doubt. We hope that students will learn how to take intellectual as well as physical risks. Students who are capable of being different, going against the grain of the common, thinking of new ideas and testing them with peers as well as teachers, are more likely to be successful in this age of innovation and uncertainty.///We approach uncertainty with forethought and determination; we work independently and cooperatively to explore new ideas and innovative strategies. We are resourceful and resilient in the face of challenges and change.","Risk taking is the ability to overcome the possibility of failure, embarrassment, or harm in order to achieve a specific goal or to acquire a particular want or need.

It encompasses the regulation of one’s own emotions both in social contexts and non-social contexts (such as delayed gratification). This construct is also strongly related to executive function, specifically inhibitory control (Liew, 2012).///Managing one's own behavior///Control (self-control) includes a range of self-regulatory skills that are evident when individuals are able to modulate and restrain their impulses or immediate reactions to stimuli. Control skills such as the ability to effectively focus attention, delay gratification, and inhibit impulsive responding are crucial for early academic achievement and have been linked to later adjustment, educational, and occupational success. They also are important for problem solving, as they allow individuals to “stop and think” before acting and respond in a controlled rather than automatic fashion. Control is related to the concept of delay discounting in that low levels of impulse control are linked to higher levels of discounting future rewards. Self-control is an important skill complement to Conscientiousness.///Self-management, also referred to as “self-control” or “self-regulation,” is the ability to regulate one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations. This includes managing stress, delaying gratification, motivating oneself, and setting and working toward personal and academic goals.

Inhibitory control, along with flexible switching, has been identified as one of the first executive function skills to emerge, developing quickly during the pre-school years (Diamond and Doar, 1989; Diamond et al., 2002). Inhibitory control skills help children suppress inappropriate behaviours and thoughts that may distract them from instruction (Alexander et al., 1993; Blair, 2002; Sa?ez et al. 2012). Further, these skills are essential for cognition, educational attainment and social functioning (Blair, 2002; Espy et al., 2004). Measured prior to kindergarten, inhibitory control predicts mathematics skills in kindergarten; when measured in kindergarten, it predicts mathematics and early literacy skills in primary school (Blair and Razza, 2007).///Full set of indicators in framework.///The cognitive control functions needed when one has to concentrate and think, when acting on one’s initial impulse would be ill-advised.

This means maintaining control over language, social, and motor behavior, while being sensitive and responsive to other environmental factors such as the behaviors of others who are sharing time and space.

It is our ability to plan a strategy for producing what information is needed, to be conscious of our own steps and strategies during the act of problem solving, and to reflect on and evaluate the productiveness of our own thinking. While ""inner language,"" thought to be a prerequisite, begins in most children around age five, metacognition is a key attribute of formal thought flowering about age eleven. Probably the major components of metacognition are developing a plan of action, maintaining that plan in mind over a period of time, then reflecting back on and evaluating the plan upon its completion. Planning a strategy before embarking on a course of action assists us in keeping track of the steps in the sequence of planned behavior at the conscious awareness level for the duration of the activity. It facilitates making temporal and comparative judgments, assessing the readiness for more or different activities, and monitoring our interpretations, perceptions, decisions and behaviors. An example of this would be what superior teachers do daily: developing a teaching strategy for a lesson, keeping that strategy in mind throughout the instruction, then reflecting back upon the strategy to evaluate its effectiveness in producing the desired student outcomes. Intelligent people plan for, reflect on, and evaluate the quality of their own thinking skills and strategies. Metacognition means becoming increasingly aware of one's actions and the effect of those actions on others and on the environment; forming internal questions as one searches for information and meaning, developing mental maps or plans of action, mentally rehearsing prior to performance, monitoring those plans as they are employed--being conscious of the need for midcourse correction if the plan is not meeting expectations, reflecting on the plan upon completion of the implementation for the purpose of self-evaluation, and editing mental pictures for improved performance.///Full set of indicators in framework.///Ability to reflectively monitor emotions in relation to oneself and others, such as recognizing how clear, typical, influential, or reasonable they are.",/////////

They strive to avoid overgeneralizations, deletions and distortions. Instead they support their statements with explanations, comparisons, quantification, and evidence.",///
Substance Use,FACETS (General Well-Being),using inappropriate substances including alcohol tobacco and cannabis,"Substance use is the consumption of chemicals that disrupt cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning. The most common substance use is alcohol and nicotine, but can also include a broad variety of substances, including the inappropriate use of prescribed medications. Persistent use of substances that leads to disruption in function is referred to as substance abuse. It is said that for some individuals, the recreational use of some substances may be acceptable, however, it is not clear who can safely use which substances. All evidence suggests that even the most benign of these medications and substances that are used inappropriately can have both short- and long-term disruptions in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning, even modest doses, and may also be associated with significant general health complications. Addiction is a subset of substance abuse that is characterized by habitual, often uncontrollable use of substances, and a “withdrawal syndrome” when the substances are discontinued."

It requires the student to overcome inertia, understand the starting point, and generate the necessary energy to commence work. Difficulties in this area often manifest as 'stalling' even when the student has the skills to do the work.///The student's tendency to begin assignments, activities, or responsibilities promptly without excessive prompting, avoidance, or delay.///Work initiation refers to how readily a student begins a task after it is assigned. Students with strong work initiation can transition from instructions to action, gather needed materials, and begin within a reasonable amount of time. Challenges may appear as prolonged hesitation, needing frequent prompts to start, or avoiding the first step even when the task is understood."

They intentionally form a vision of a product, plan of action, goal or a destination before they begin. They strive to clarify and understand directions, develop a strategy for approaching a problem and withhold immediate value judgments about an idea before fully understanding it. Reflective individuals consider alternatives and consequences of several possible directions prior to taking action. They decrease their need for trial and error by gathering information, taking time to reflect on an answer before giving it, making sure they understand directions, and listening to alternative points of view. Often students blurt the first answer that comes to mind. Sometimes they shout out an answer, start to work without fully understanding the directions, lack an organized plan or strategy for approaching a problem or make immediate value judgments about an idea—criticizing or praising it— before fully understanding it.///Thinking before acting","The tendency to stop and think before speaking or acting, rather than immediately responding to urges or reacting without reflection///The student's ability to pause, consider consequences, wait their turn, and regulate urges to act or speak without thinking///The student's ability to pause and consider consequences before acting, resist urges to engage in inappropriate behavior, and inhibit automatic responses when necessary.//////The student's ability to pause and consider consequences before acting, including waiting their turn and resisting immediate urges."
Thinking Speed,FACETS (Organization & Planning),adapting thinking speed to meet situational demands,"The pace of adaptive thinking varies to meet the demands of the task. Multiple factors contribute to the enormous variation in thinking speed as individuals process information, including attention, intellectual ability, interests, familiarity, and memory, as well as environment and practice. It is important to manage thinking speed in order to allocate flexible amounts of time to appropriately address varying problems and challenges. Thinking faster is not always helpful as it may lead to errors, whereas thinking slowly may lead to missed opportunities. Finding successful balance in regulating thinking speed is essential for successful adaptation."
Tics and Atypical Movements,FACETS (Motor Skills),adapting social and other behaviors in response to tics or atypical movements,"Tics (repetitive motor behaviors), as well as disruptions in motor rhythm and coordination fluidity constitute atypical movements. Atypical movements may include fine or gross motor activity, involve very rapid to very slow movements, and have varying size of movements. Tics may involve facial muscles (e.g., twitching), trunk and limb muscle movements (e.g., head and shoulder shrugging), as well vocal tics (i.e., respiratory and laryngeal muscle movements yielding either sounds or words.) Atypical movements often make affected individuals feel sad, embarrassed, frustrated, and anxious; they often become victims of mockery, shaming, and bullying."
Toileting Problems,FACETS (General Well-Being),managing toileting behaviors and routines,"Managing toileting and hygiene is a basic social and behavioral skill that is essential for successful adaptive function. It includes self-management of excretions, as well as cleaning oneself. Intrinsic to managing toileting and hygiene, is a personal understanding of one’s own daily rhythms and the extent to which one can control them, in the context of other environmental events (e.g., school/work, leisure, sleep, meals etc.). Therefore successful toileting and hygiene includes proper scheduling and the use of socially-appropriate behaviors to complete toileting and hygiene tasks."

It is based on the understanding developed by moral philosophers that acknowledges that human beings are equal participants in a common ethical world by virtue of their human status (Janoff-Bulmann et al., 2008). In this composite life skill, the concept of diversity means understanding that each individual is unique and recognizing each other’s individual differences. These can be defined along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other characteristics. Respect for diversity thus implies more than just tolerance, which is related to accepting differences passively, it means acknowledging and promoting the equal worth of peoples, without condescension (UNICEF, 2007b).///Appreciate that part of our shared reality is the diversity, uniqueness and difference of individuals and groups, learning to respect those differences and the way they add to our collective life///Young person has knowledge of and comfort with people of different cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds.///Full set of indicators in framework.","Tolerance is the willingness and ability to thoughtfully and fairly judge values and belief systems.

It is important to anticipate pending transitions and plan for what comes next. The departure requires the timely gathering of objects necessary for the transition, so that the departure can take place in an orderly and timely fashion. Transitions routines often use appropriate social elements (e.g., “Good-bye,” “See you tomorrow,” “Thank you,” waving or hugs, etc.), as well as addressing of safety concerns (e.g., “hold my hand”, “put on your seat belt”, etc.)///The student's ability to smoothly shift from one activity, setting, or task to another throughout the school day.///The ease with which the student shifts from one task, setting, or activity to another without significant distress or behavioral disruption.///The degree to which a student can shift smoothly between tasks"
Trauma History,FACETS (General Well-Being),having directly or indirectly experienced traumatic events,"In the course of typical, daily life, there are events of varying intensity that cause emotional or physical pain or disturbance (e.g., injury or death of a loved one). While upsetting and possibly causing “trauma-related symptoms,” they are not likely to lead to a trauma diagnosis. These symptoms generally resolve quickly and without long-term impact. On occasion, depending on the individual and the nature of the events, symptoms may persist. And, even more rarely, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), may appear. Severe traumatic reactions are generally associated with events in which the individual’s health safety and/or life are in immediate jeopardy. Individuals are more likely to be affected the closer they are in time and space to traumatic events."
