FACETS,Academic Skills and School Functioning,Academic Motivation,applying skills and abilities to achieve academic goals,"Academic motivation is an individual’s general commitment to scholarly/learning activities. It includes not only the determination to acquire knowledge and skills in school, but also the development of the tools necessary to successfully perform in the academic context. While often reduced to “grades,” this method fails to capture the commitment necessary to establish and maintain appropriate subject level knowledge and skills (e.g., mathematics, science, language, history, etc.), as well as the willingness to flexibly and adaptively use general and specific resources (e.g., mentors, libraries, collaboration, etc.) needed to succeed."
FACETS,Academic Skills and School Functioning,Mathematics,cognitively and mechanically performing arithmetic operations,"Math, or arithmetic, is the ability to manage numerical and/or quantitative ideas, both conceptually and in graphical representations. Mathematical skills evolve over time, beginning using numbers for the concrete counting of objects, evolving into the appreciation that numbers can representing various constructs such as quantity, time, space, etc. Success with math can be confounded by writing difficulty as “imprecise” presentation of numbers leads to errors."
FACETS,Academic Skills and School Functioning,Reading,cognitive and mechanical elements of reading comprehension,"Reading is the ability to decode written symbols for purposes of communication and learning. While reading most commonly focuses on symbols referred to as “letters” or “characters” from alphabets, in fact, decoding any symbols is a form of reading, including symbols such as logos, flags, and other devices. Reading most languages requires understanding of components of writing include grammar, syntax, punctuation, sentences, paragraphs etc."
FACETS,Academic Skills and School Functioning,Writing,cognitive and mechanical elements of written expression,"Writing is the graphical representation of ideas that consists of two separate and distinct actions. The first is the cognitive process of changing an idea into the symbols (letters, characters, or other) in preparation for writing. The second is the motor process of producing the “written” symbols that present an idea in whatever medium is chosen (paper, computer screen, etc.), in a fashion that is potentially comprehensible by others. While letters and complex symbols form the basis of developmentally sophisticated writing, the simple graphic productions (e.g., scribbles) of young children and others with limited skills, can be very effective communication tools."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Activity Level,maintaining physical and cognitive activity,"For successful adaptation, it is critical that individuals apply activity levels consistent with the tasks and the environment. Activity consists of all manner of functions, including gross and fine motor activity as well as cognition, emotions, and other aspects of biological and social functioning."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Assertiveness,initiating actions to support interests goals and desires,"Aggression is the full spectrum of assertive behaviors, with assertiveness representing the forceful interaction with the environment to obtain needs or goals. Assertiveness includes a broad range of behaviors that vary widely based on individual differences, culture, and context. These contexts may include school, work, athletics and other competitive activities, and in some cases, it can lead to forms of violence, associated with personal protection, criminal activity, and war. A key to successful adaptation is the flexible and appropriate application of assertiveness in the course of work and play."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Compliance,following rules and instructions adaptively,"Compliance is adherence to rules or directions, consistent with the setting or environment (e.g., school, work, home, etc.) in order to achieve goals and objectives."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Habits/Routines,managing recurring habits,"Habits are well-practiced routines that are essential for managing daily function by creating efficiency and effectiveness processes for managing recurring tasks and addressing familiar problems. Habits are automatic behaviors, but, when necessary for successful adaptation, can be modified to accommodate changing circumstances."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Morning Routine,being ready when arriving at school,"Most people have a set of behaviors or actions for the beginning of each day that generally follow in a usual order and are designed to complete necessary tasks in preparation for the day’s activities. They begin with arising with sufficient time to avoid being late for the start of school, work or other daytime obligations; routines may include activities such as toileting, hygiene, dressing appropriately, eating, gathering one’s necessary belongings, and departing in a timely fashion so as to arrive at the first appointment of the day. Typically these routines are well-established so that they occur relatively automatically, obviating the need for detailed thinking about each task. In some cases, the individual does some preparation the evening before, in order to assure prompt completion of morning routines."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Physically Harms Self,causing injury to self,"Persistent thoughts of self-harm, especially thoughts that lead to actions causing harm, are always problematic, and usually require urgent attention. Self-harm may or may not have suicidal intent, although the risk for suicidal behavior is increased in the presence of self-harm. In moments of despair or incredible anger, typical individuals may rarely have thoughts of self-harm. However, these thoughts are readily recognized as inappropriate and quickly managed without any action directed toward self-harm."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Physically or Emotionally Harms Others,causing physical or emotional harm to other persons,"Persistent thoughts of harm to others, especially those that lead to actions that cause harm are always problematic, and usually require urgent attention. Harm to others may also include emotional harm. Ideas about harming others usually has no homicidal intent, however, these wishes to cause physical or emotional harm to others may lead to serious consequences. As a result, in the presence of these thoughts, careful evaluations are necessary, and targets of the harmful thoughts (e.g., animals, children, other adults) should be protected until the potential threat has passed."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Risk Taking,taking chances to achieve goals when faced with possible failure embarrassment or harm,"Risk taking is the ability to overcome the possibility of failure, embarrassment, or harm in order to achieve a specific goal or to acquire a particular want or need. Appropriate risk taking requires a sensible analysis of the balance between outcomes and the possible consequences of a particular action."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Self-Control,managing impulses and self-regulating behavior,"Effective social adaptations and goal seeking requires the ability to resist non-productive impulses and distractions that may interfere with achieving a goal. Self-control is the ability to manage the full spectrum of one’s behaviors in order to quickly, flexibly, and effectively adapt as one attempts to meet one’s personal and social needs. This means maintaining control over language, social, and motor behavior, while being sensitive and responsive to other environmental factors such as the behaviors of others who are sharing time and space. Self-control includes the ability to both behave proactively and reactively, as well as to inhibit unnecessary or inappropriate behavior."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Sensory Reactivity,responding to sensory input including touch taste smell sight hearing and somatic,"There is enormous individual variability in the perception and ability to interpret and respond to sensory input. Sensations typically includes the five senses (e.g., touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing), however, somatic perceptions (e.g., pain, heart rate, respiratory rate, kinesthetics, etc.) are often sensed quite acutely, and can modulate emotions, cognitions, and behavior. Precision in the identification of sensory inputs and the reaction to them is essential for safe interactions with the environment as well as appropriate social function."
FACETS,Behavior Control and Regulation,Transitions,transitioning between activities or places,"Leaving home or other sites (e.g., school) requires preparation that is often captured in routines so that all the elements of the departure are well-coordinated, with little emotional or behavioral disruption, and no necessary items are left behind. It is important to anticipate pending transitions and plan for what comes next. The departure requires the timely gathering of objects necessary for the transition, so that the departure can take place in an orderly and timely fashion. Transitions routines often use appropriate social elements (e.g., “Good-bye,” “See you tomorrow,” “Thank you,” waving or hugs, etc.), as well as addressing of safety concerns (e.g., “hold my hand”, “put on your seat belt”, etc.)"
FACETS,Disposition,Future Outlook,having thoughts and feelings about the future,"Future outlook is the ability and willingness to flexibly think about and imagine the future, and adaptively anticipate what is to come in the near-and-short-term. A perspective on the future is usually accompanied by an attitude about what opportunities, threats, and goals lie ahead, an attitude that can shape actions and preparations related to potential future events."
FACETS,Disposition,Perseverance,persisting when undertaking tasks,"Perseverance is the ability to keep working on tasks, even in the face of obstacles such as distractions, difficulties, and delays. Determination and commitment to acquiring knowledge and skills is a powerful force for most youth, however, it requires the ability to stay focused on a task and continue working, even in the face of interference and disruptions."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Anger Management,managing responses when provoked,"Anger is a typical experience that reflects the strong expression of annoyance, frustration, or displeasure. While anger is a typical emotion, reactions can vary from well-regulated and appropriate, to poorly modulated, disruptive, and even violent."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Emotion Regulation/Reactivity,managing threshold and intensity of emotional responses,"Emotions are strong feelings derived from internal and external stimuli that are reflected in mood and responsive to environmental factors and relationships with others. These feelings may range broadly and include joy, happiness, love, euphoria, anxiety, sadness, fear, loss, and many more. These emotions play a critical role in social communication, motivation, and protection. However, in order to maintain adaptive functioning, emotions require careful regulation in terms of type, intensity, and duration of emotional expression, each of which must be sensitive to environmental, social, and cultural factors."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Irritability,reacting to frustration or annoyance,"Irritability is a feeling of agitation and annoyance in response to a stimulus or stress. Irritability can be an appropriate response to a offensive social or physical stimulus that becomes problematic, however, the appropriate intensity of such a response varies based on the intensity and persistence of the stimulus, as well as the social context. Irritability can range from a mild facial expression or gesture to a massive outpouring of emotions."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Obsessive Thoughts,managing recurring thoughts or ideas,"Sustained, recurring, goal-directed thoughts or ideas assist in focussing attention and activity in support of completing a task. In addition to helping sustain attention or focus, revisiting the thought or idea supports problem-solving or re-working options necessary to achieve a goal. When these thoughts are persistent and intrusive, they interfere with social, behavioral, and/or cognitive function. Persistent thoughts may include perseveration on specific or irrelevant topics, numbers, words, sounds, or tasks."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Stress Management,managing tension resulting from challenges or demands,"Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension that is the body’s reaction to an internal or external challenge or demand. The internal factors can be thoughts, ideas, emotions, or even cognitive and emotional challenges. External factors may include leisure, work, or social demands. The response to stress can be both cognitive-emotional, as well as physiologic. Stress responses are adaptive when they are developmentally and behaviorally appropriate to the intensity, complexity, and duration of the demand or challenge."
FACETS,Emotional Expression,Worries/Anxiety/Fears,managing worries and anxiety,"Worries are the result of fears or anxiety. The stimulus for worries can be internal or external. External worries often come from frightening or forbidden objects or events. Internal worries are often associated with self-doubt or lack of confidence, as well as legitimate concerns about objects or events from the past or anticipated in the future. Worries come in many forms, and while they generally reflect internal feeling states, they are commonly expressed as behaviors including the appearance of being anxious, excess vocalization of the worry, or avoidance."
FACETS,Expressive Communication,Expressive Language,communicating with speech and gestures,"Expressive Language includes words and sounds, powerfully augmented by non-verbal communication, including gestures, body posture, facial expression etc. There are many subtle elements that enhance the breadth, depth and nuance of expressive language. These include rate, rhythm, volume, prosody, and tone of speech, as well as vocabulary and word choice. Effective expressive communication requires the flexible, skillful combination of gestures and spoken words. It takes considerable effort to communicate functionally, yet remarkably, even from early life, typically developing individuals are able to express to others their ideas, feelings, wants, and needs. These skills grow in complexity over the course of the lifespan, however, there is considerable variability amongst individuals that depends on biological make-up, cognitive ability, environmental factors, and cultural/social experiences."
FACETS,Expressive Communication,Speech Quality,speaking understandably,"Speech is the production of sounds that are most often formed into words which can be linked to form sentences, paragraphs, descriptions, requests, stories, and much more. Using variations in rate, tone, rhythm, volume, clarity, word/sound selection, coordination with non-verbal communication, and other elements of sound production enhance the understandability of the intended communication. Flexible and adaptable speech offers greater possibility that the intended message will be received and properly interpreted by the listener."
FACETS,Expressive Communication,Speech Quantity,speaking with an appropriate number of words for communication,"Language is the full spectrum of communicative behaviors. It includes words, gestures, body posture, facial expression, and a myriad of other behaviors that have communicative intent. This item refers ONLY to spoken language - speech. There is enormous variation in speech quantity that is partly dependent on context (“Is this a time to be quiet or a time to offer to speak up?”) and also depends on the capability of the individual to speak about specific content (“Does the individual know anything about the present topic?” “Are they lacking confidence with respect to that content?”) Or, does the individual have the physical ability to produce speech at all. Thus, the quantity of speech may typically vary depending on context and content, however, individuals with problems related to speech quantity have difficulty regulating the amount of speaking in appropriate response to the context or content."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Eating,maintaining dietary intake and nutrition,"Eating is a complex behavior that has both nutritional and social components. The nutritional component is the appropriate consumption of both calories (for energy) and the elements of the diet (protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, etc.) necessary for maintaining healthy function. There are two main social components of eating: the social interactions associated with the preparation and consumption of food, and the cultural elements associated with menus, dining schedules, and food consumption (e.g., Kosher, Hallal, vegan/vegetarian, etc.) Food preparation and dining are often social experiences that reflect culture and other expectations for cooperation and sharing of both food and conversation, as well as engagement in a variety of behaviors directly associated with eating, such as use of specific utensils (chopsticks, fork, spoon, hands, etc.), cleanliness, order, and the nature of physical presence (e.g., sitting in a chair, standing, walking, sitting cross-legged on the floor, use of a particular hand, etc.) Appropriate participation in all elements of eating are important for health and happiness."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Inadequate Self-Care/Hygiene,not maintaining appropriate cleanliness,"Hygiene is a group of practices that are primarily designed to maintain cleanliness and prevention of disease. However, in addition to a health component, there is a strong social component to hygiene that is culturally driven. This includes grooming practices, attire, and general standards of tidiness. To meet the basic health obligations for hygiene requires regular washing and bathing of the body as well as washing clothes. To meet the social obligations of hygiene not only includes cleanliness, but also attending to standards for physical presentation. This includes various elements and depends on culture and environment. Some factors may include the type of clean clothing, cleaning teeth, arranging hair, trimming and painting nails, the use of makeup, management of body odor, etc."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Screen Time,managing screen-based activities including education games entertainment and social media,"“Screens” refers to devices such as computers, television, tablets, e-readers, smartphones, and hand-held video games. Regulation of screen time requires careful planning and coordination as the use of “screens” may play crucial roles in both academic and social life. Screen time has two components: duration and content. While some materials and exposures may be safe and appropriate, other can be quite dangerous."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Sleep Disturbance,evidence of inadequate duration or quality of sleep including drowsiness and persistent lack of energy,"While the precise function of sleep is unknown, sleep appears to be a physiological state in which the brain rests and resets some of its functions. While the brain is engaged in sleep, the remainder of the human body also gets a chance to rest and recover from the physical exertion of the previous day. Sleep may also play a restorative role for physiologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning and wellbeing. Sleep has discrete stages, one of which allows for dreaming. Typically, individuals sleep varying amounts of time, ranging from 4-10 hours, usually, but not necessarily occurring at night. Daytime napping may also be a healthy component of sleep. One goal for sleep is to gain adequate amounts of rest to support ongoing activities during the waking hours. Pre-bedtime and bedtime routines are commonly associated with sleep, and may include social activities (e.g., story telling, prayers, reading, etc.). Sleep difficulties include either inadequate or excessive amounts of sleep, as well as excessive and inappropriate daytime drowsiness."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Substance Use,using inappropriate substances including alcohol tobacco and cannabis,"Substance use is the consumption of chemicals that disrupt cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning. The most common substance use is alcohol and nicotine, but can also include a broad variety of substances, including the inappropriate use of prescribed medications. Persistent use of substances that leads to disruption in function is referred to as substance abuse. It is said that for some individuals, the recreational use of some substances may be acceptable, however, it is not clear who can safely use which substances. All evidence suggests that even the most benign of these medications and substances that are used inappropriately can have both short- and long-term disruptions in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or other adaptive functioning, even modest doses, and may also be associated with significant general health complications. Addiction is a subset of substance abuse that is characterized by habitual, often uncontrollable use of substances, and a “withdrawal syndrome” when the substances are discontinued."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Toileting Problems,managing toileting behaviors and routines,"Managing toileting and hygiene is a basic social and behavioral skill that is essential for successful adaptive function. It includes self-management of excretions, as well as cleaning oneself. Intrinsic to managing toileting and hygiene, is a personal understanding of one’s own daily rhythms and the extent to which one can control them, in the context of other environmental events (e.g., school/work, leisure, sleep, meals etc.). Therefore successful toileting and hygiene includes proper scheduling and the use of socially-appropriate behaviors to complete toileting and hygiene tasks."
FACETS,General Well-Being,Trauma History,having directly or indirectly experienced traumatic events,"In the course of typical, daily life, there are events of varying intensity that cause emotional or physical pain or disturbance (e.g., injury or death of a loved one). While upsetting and possibly causing “trauma-related symptoms,” they are not likely to lead to a trauma diagnosis. These symptoms generally resolve quickly and without long-term impact. On occasion, depending on the individual and the nature of the events, symptoms may persist. And, even more rarely, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), may appear. Severe traumatic reactions are generally associated with events in which the individual’s health safety and/or life are in immediate jeopardy. Individuals are more likely to be affected the closer they are in time and space to traumatic events."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Attachment,having attachments to family peers and adults,"Attachment is the strong, bilateral, emotional connection between humans (and other animals). Initially, this connection is with the individual’s primary caregivers, but it rapidly expands to include others important to the life of the individual. In humans, attachments usually begin in the first days of life, becoming more socially, emotionally, and behaviorally complex over time."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Bullying,involvement as victim perpetrator or encouraging observer,"Bullying, the most common form of interpersonal violence, is a recurrent pattern of behavior that takes place when one individual takes advantage of a power differential to cause physical or emotional harm to another. Participants in bullying may be victims, perpetrators, and victim-perpetrators, as well as active and passive by-standers/observers. Each of those involved in bullying can suffer adverse consequences from the experience."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Empathy,having sensitivity to the feelings and needs of others,Empathy is the ability to understand the emotions and emotional state of another person (and some animals.)
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Play,playing well alone and with others,"Play is a complex set of behaviors, largely for the purpose of enjoyment, but may also provide a tool for experimentation and problem-solving in a safe or non-competitive environment. Play activities include social and imaginary use of objects and relationships as well as opportunities to practice a full spectrum of social skills, behavioral control, problem solving and much more. The complexity and function of play develops along with the development of cognitive and motor function, routines and habits, knowledge and skills, and much more. Play takes place in individual and social contexts. It may include games and toys, as well as tools and tasks typically a part of daily work (e.g., pencils, cooking utensils, sports equipment, etc.). While these playful interactions may seem to be of little purpose, they are actually serious attempts at mastery, role-playing, and practice that sets the stage for real-life skills and activities. This actual nature of the practice varies as a result of a variety of factors including context, social relationships, and developmental age."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Social Communication,communication enabling social interactions,"Social functioning is the ability to share thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors. Social communication includes words and gestures in conjunction with an “invitation” to respond, as well as the willingness to receive and accept social responses. This leads to reciprocity, or “turn-taking,” the repeated exchanges of thoughts, needs, ideas, and behaviors that form the basis of conversation, discussion, collaborative work, and play."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Social Cooperation,cooperating in social interactions including play,"Cooperation is working together with other individuals, or in groups, to achieve a common goal or objective. This requires effective communication for sharing of thoughts, ideas, and plans, as well as a willingness to be flexible and context sensitive when sharing behaviors and communications."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Social Engagement,engaging in social behavior,"Social engagement is the combination of intent to form and maintain social interactions combined with the appropriate and flexible application of social speech, cues, gestures, and behaviors (e.g., smiling, visual regard, hand shaking/bowing, etc.). Social engagement directs these behaviors toward individuals or groups, with the goal of establishing and maintaining reciprocal, social transactions and relationships."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Tolerance,responding appropriately to differences in cultures and belief systems,"Tolerance is the willingness and ability to thoughtfully and fairly judge values and belief systems. This includes treating fairly, and with respect and courtesy, those with varied abilities and identities, as well as those from different cultures, values, and beliefs."
FACETS,Interacting with Others,Responsibility for Self & Others,accepting responsibility for actions taken by self or others,"Responsibility is the willingness and ability to appropriately manage or control self, situations and/or the actions of other individuals. The ability to assume responsibility begins with managing one’s own actions, emotions, and cognitions, then gradually expands to being more in control of interactions with others and broader elements of the environment. When faced with new tasks or uncertainty, there may be cautionary over-control followed by fading to a balance between self-control and sharing control with others."
FACETS,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,Abstract Thinking,understanding and applying abstract concepts such as analogies and metaphors,"Abstraction is the ability to think flexibly about ideas rather than just concrete circumstances, including words and events. The ability to engage in abstract thinking is essential to many forms of human expression, including mathematics, science, literature, play, humor etc. Abstract thinking includes skills such as the ability to think about numbers without having something to count, and to play “make-believe” or to tell an imaginary story (e.g., fairy tales). Without abstract thinking, it is difficult to expand thoughts and ideas beyond the concrete objects, limiting creative problem-solving."
FACETS,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,Creativity,applying novel strategies to problem-solving,"Creativity is the ability to see beyond traditionals constraints and rules, and to allow imagination as well as novel and unique ideas to help solve new problems, offer alternative solutions to existing tasks or problems, and provide unique perspectives on the many aspects of our daily lives."
FACETS,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,Distorted Perceptions of Reality,inappropriate or inaccurate interpretation of events experiences and thoughts,"Perception of reality, or “reality testing,” is the ability to consistently discern the difference between facts and fantasy or other imagined thought content and perceptions. While each of us may have a vivid imagination and fantasies, except under extraordinary circumstances, we can readily distinguish between reality and that which we imagine. The extraordinary circumstances under which clearly recognizing reality may be impaired, include: extreme stress, during intense grief, when very defensive, and when engaged in intense play or similar activity. In these latter cases, the difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy/imagination is usually short-lived and quite specific to the circumstances (e.g., seeing visions of the presence of a recently deceased person). Specific difficulties associated with problems in reality perception include: hallucination (i.e., hearing, seeing, feeling or other sensation in the absence or an actual stimulus), delusion (i.e., a false belief), illusion (i.e., gross misperception of an actual stimulus), etc."
FACETS,Learning with Reasoning and Abstraction,Learning Strategies,adopting and developing strategies for learning new material,"Learning strategies are the full spectrum of creative, flexible approaches and tools for the acquisition of new knowledge. It includes all facets of learning in school and extra-curricular settings, as well as how one approaches learning life skills at home and in the community (e.g., music, dance, sports, game playing, cooking, cleaning, community social functions, riding bicycles, magic tricks, etc.) For skillful adaptation, effective and efficient learning strategies must vary with development, experience, and the nature of the learning task. Examples of learning strategies include changing oral tasks into written tasks, breaking large problems into a sequence of small problems, etc."
FACETS,Motor Skills,Fine Motor Skills,performing the full spectrum of fine motor activities,"Fine motor skills are represented by small motor movements, most commonly the product of the small muscle groups of the hands, fingers, toes, face and neck. It takes a great deal of coordination to effectively use the many muscle groups involved in fine motor activity. The coordination includes input from the kinesthetic, visual, and somatosensory systems, as well as practice for complex tasks, such as writing, drawing, speaking, and facial expression."
FACETS,Motor Skills,Gross Motor Skills,performing the full spectrum of gross motor activities,"Gross motor skills are generally large amplitude motor movements, most commonly the product of the larger muscle groups of the limbs and trunk. Since there are many muscle groups involved in gross motor activity they must be coordinated to be effective. The coordination includes input from the kinesthetic, visual, and somatosensory systems, as well as practice for complex tasks, including walking. Skilled gross motor activity sets the stage for success in many areas including athletics, dance, cycling, driving etc."
FACETS,Motor Skills,Tics and Atypical Movements,adapting social and other behaviors in response to tics or atypical movements,"Tics (repetitive motor behaviors), as well as disruptions in motor rhythm and coordination fluidity constitute atypical movements. Atypical movements may include fine or gross motor activity, involve very rapid to very slow movements, and have varying size of movements. Tics may involve facial muscles (e.g., twitching), trunk and limb muscle movements (e.g., head and shoulder shrugging), as well vocal tics (i.e., respiratory and laryngeal muscle movements yielding either sounds or words.) Atypical movements often make affected individuals feel sad, embarrassed, frustrated, and anxious; they often become victims of mockery, shaming, and bullying."
FACETS,Organization & Planning,Attention/Concentration,sustaining attention and concentration,"Attention is the ability to focus interests, cognition, emotions and/or other resources on a particular object, goal, idea, effort, activity, etc. Attention and concentration are cognitive processes that allow for the selection and focus on a particular task or object (including goals, ideas, etc.) for some period of time. It is usually easier to pay attention when there is strong interest, feeling or commitment to a particular topic or goal. Concentration and attention can vary by environment and other concomitant obligations. Most children and adults can maintain concentration on an important topic for 30-40 minutes. Attention and concentration often require active avoidance of distraction. Failure to maintain attention often leads to mistakes and interruptions in important tasks."
FACETS,Organization & Planning,Memory/Recall,expending effort and employing strategies for remembering and recalling,"Memory is a complex biological function that allows for the brain to store and recall factual information and related emotional and other factors that are linked to the facts. There are multiple forms of memory to account for different uses of the stored information. Short-term memory is for the management of information that is needed temporarily to complete a brief task. For intermediate level activities, information from short-term memory is transferred to working memory for more extended task completion. Long-term memory is information that may be used again and again and/or over extended periods of time. The durability of a particular memory depends a great deal on the importance of that which is being remembered, the linkages of that memory to other important factors (i.e., emotions, location, sensory associations, other memories, etc.), repetition of the memory over the course of time, and distractions or disruptions when the memory is being stored."
FACETS,Organization & Planning,Planning and Organization,developing plans to complete tasks,"Planning and organization, often referred to as “executive functions,” make it possible to allocate cognitive and other resources to successfully sequence and complete tasks. Planning and organization are learned skills that require the appropriate application of attention, cognitive ability, and memoryin order to create and sustain a plan. This includes both short-term and long-term planning for projects, assignments, and other activities. It also includes the monitoring of these processes and plans in order to assure progress toward the desired goal. While younger children have difficulty with executive functions due to a limited concept of time, with maturity, it is possible to manage more and multiple complex tasks, with intermixed goals and objectives."
FACETS,Organization & Planning,Task Completion,recognizing beginning structure and end of tasks,"It is typical to spontaneously take on tasks and willingly accept task assignments. Task completion is the ability to appreciate that all tasks have beginnings and ends, while also finding satisfaction in moving to and achieving a goal. Without fear, one recognizes that failure and/or inability to complete the task sometimes occurs. Managing failure and other disruptions is critical to consistent task completion, even in the face of potential disappointment."
FACETS,Organization & Planning,Thinking Speed,adapting thinking speed to meet situational demands,"The pace of adaptive thinking varies to meet the demands of the task. Multiple factors contribute to the enormous variation in thinking speed as individuals process information, including attention, intellectual ability, interests, familiarity, and memory, as well as environment and practice. It is important to manage thinking speed in order to allocate flexible amounts of time to appropriately address varying problems and challenges. Thinking faster is not always helpful as it may lead to errors, whereas thinking slowly may lead to missed opportunities. Finding successful balance in regulating thinking speed is essential for successful adaptation."
FACETS,Receptive Communication,Receptive Language,recognizing and understanding words and gestures as communication,"Receptive language is the capacity to comprehend verbal and non-verbal messages provided by others in the environment. It requires the ability to appreciate the nuances of communication (e.g., gesture, body posture, rhythm, volume, vocabulary, prosody, tone, etc.); each of these elements enhance the effectiveness and comprehension of communicative intent. In order to receive communication, the individual must attend to the critical elements of language, as well as the ability to focus on and interpret communication directed specifically at the individual, as well as more broadly with the environment. These skills grow in complexity over the course of the lifespan, however, there is considerable variability amongst individuals that depends on their biological make-up, cognitive ability, culture, and social experience."
FACETS,Sense of Self,Integrity and Honesty,recognizing and sharing truths and falsehoods with others,"Integrity is the commitment to being honest and principled in one’s approach to problem-solving, as well as in social interactions. There are two major failures in integrity: 1) Errors of commission - specifically being dishonest or representing an untruth; and, 2) Errors of omission - specifically withholding important information required for a fair and balanced approach to a specific circumstance or situation."
FACETS,Sense of Self,Self-Confidence,assessing one's belief in their ability,Confidence is an individual’s belief in their own ability to take on and succeed at a task or challenge.
FACETS,Sense of Self,Self-Image,recognizing one's own strengths and weaknesses,"Self-image is the internal sense of identity. It not only includes objective perception of self, along with wishes and aspirations as well as the notion of how one compares to others. The objective components of self-image include perceptions of how one looks, feels, thinks, and acts, placed in a cultural frame, that includes lessons learned from peers, family members, and the community (e.g., role models, social media, etc.)."
FACETS,Sense of Self,Sexual/Gender Identity and Behavior,expressing age-appropriate sexual identity and behavior,"Sexual behavior includes behaviors that are related to an individual's particular individual “sexual identity.” While there are generally male and female biological differences amongst humans, there exists a broad spectrum of gender-related behaviors that are “assigned” or “learned,” based on cultural and social expectations in a community, not infrequently independent of “sex assigned at birth.” Some behaviors appear to be “assigned,” and are often considered “conventional.” When there are variations that don’t meet social expectations, it can cause discomfort - for children, peers, and/or adults - and can lead to adverse outcomes like bullying, discrimination and social isolation. Examples of these are so-called “effeminate” males or “masculine” females. Most “unconventional” gender behaviors are not abnormal but simply represent the broad variation in expressions of identity."
